[2000]. Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2. Circle Pines, MN: American Guidance Services). The study used CI age as a referent for 32 children who received their CI before 30 months of age. Consonants produced by 70% of the children were listed, as were the most common error types, which were consonant omissions and substitutions. Using consonant repertoire lists and standard scores, the study revealed that children with CIs had acquisition patterns that were similar to their peers when the duration of CI experience was similar to the chronological age norms of typically developing children. The results revealed that CI users need time to coordinate their articulatory organizing principles with the input they receive from their CI. It is appropriate to use length of CI use as a proxy for chronological age during the first 4 years when comparing articulation development with hearing peers.', '22328229': 'The development of engineered skeletal muscle would provide a viable tissue for replacement and repair of muscle damaged by disease or injury. Our current tissue-engineering methods result in three-dimensional (3D) muscle constructs that generate tension but do not advance phenotypically beyond neonatal characteristics. To develop to an adult phenotype, innervation and vascularization of the construct must occur. In this study, 3D muscle constructs were implanted into the hindlimb of a rat, along the sciatic nerve, with the sural nerve isolated, transected and sutured to the construct to encourage innervation. Aortic ring anchors were sutured to the tendons of the biceps femoris muscle so that the construct would move dynamically with the endogenous muscle. After 1\\u2009week in vivo, the constructs were explanted, evaluated for force production and stained for muscle, nerve and collagen markers. Implanted muscle constructs showed a developing capillary system, an epimysium-like outer layer of connective tissue and an increase in myofibre content. The beginning of α-bungarotoxin clustering suggests that neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) could form on the implanted muscle, given more time in vivo. Additionally, the constructs increased maximum isometric force from 192\\u2009±\\u200941 μN to 549\\u2009±\\u2009103 μN (245% increase) compared to in vitro controls, which increased from 276\\u2009±\\u200923 μN to 329\\u2009±\\u200927μN (25% increase). These findings suggest that engineered muscle tissue survives 1\\u2009week of implantation and begins to develop the necessary interfaces needed to advance the phenotype toward adult muscle. However, in terms of force production, the muscle constructs need longer implantation times to fully develop an adult phenotype.', '24019029': 'To observe tolerance to drug effects on operant behavior, the dose that researchers have often selected for chronic administration is one that disrupts, but does not abolish, responding. Some evidence suggests that tolerance may develop after chronic administration of relatively smaller doses. The purpose of the present experiment was to assess systematically effects of chronic administration of a dose without detected effect on responding. Specifically, response rates and post-reinforcement pauses of five pigeons key pecking under a three-component multiple fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement were observed under chronic cocaine administration. We evaluated the effects of a range of doses (1.0 mg/kg to 17.0 \\u2009mg/kg) during acute administration. The largest dose that failed to alter responding acutely then was administered chronically (1.0 \\u2009mg/kg for 1 pigeon, 3.0\\u2009 mg/kg for 3 pigeons, and 5.6 \\u2009mg/kg for 1 pigeon). After 30 consecutive sessions of chronic administration, smaller and larger doses occasionally were substituted for the chronic dose. Pigeons then received pre-session saline administration for 30 consecutive sessions, and the post-chronic effects of the series of doses on responding were determined. All subjects developed tolerance to doses of cocaine that initially had caused large decreases in rate, with the magnitude of the effects varying across components of the multiple schedule and subjects. Specifically, tolerance generally was greatest in the components with smaller ratios. Following post-chronic saline administration, tolerance was usually diminished. Overall, the results demonstrate that under these conditions, repeated experience with disruptive effects of cocaine on food-maintained responding is not a necessary factor in the development of tolerance.', '23853575': 'Glycan masking is an emerging vaccine design strategy to focus antibody responses to specific epitopes, but it has mostly been evaluated on the already heavily glycosylated HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Here this approach was used to investigate the binding interaction of Plasmodium vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and to evaluate if glycan-masked PvDBPII immunogens would focus the antibody response on key interaction surfaces. Four variants of PVDBPII were generated and probed for function and immunogenicity. Whereas two PvDBPII glycosylation variants with increased glycan surface coverage distant from predicted interaction sites had equivalent binding activity to wild-type protein, one of them elicited slightly better DARC-binding-inhibitory activity than wild-type immunogen. Conversely, the addition of an N-glycosylation site adjacent to a predicted PvDBP interaction site both abolished its interaction with DARC and resulted in weaker inhibitory antibody responses. PvDBP is composed of three subdomains and is thought to function as a dimer; a meta-analysis of published PvDBP mutants and the new DBPII glycosylation variants indicates that critical DARC binding residues are concentrated at the dimer interface and along a relatively flat surface spanning portions of two subdomains. Our findings suggest that DARC-binding-inhibitory antibody epitope(s) lie close to the predicted DARC interaction site, and that addition of N-glycan sites distant from this site may augment inhibitory antibodies. Thus, glycan resurfacing is an attractive and feasible tool to investigate protein structure-function, and glycan-masked PvDBPII immunogens might contribute to P. vivax vaccine development.', '24128149': 'According to alcohol expectancy theory, drinking-related information is stored in memory and, when cue activated, influences alcohol-related behavior. Priming of alcohol cues and expectancies has been shown to elicit both drinking and nonconsumptive behavior associated with alcohol consumption, such as willingness to meet with a stranger and aggression. These social influence effects have been shown to be moderated by individual differences in alcohol expectancies. In the present study, we tested whether an alcohol prime would facilitate social group bonding even in the absence of consumption, and whether such group bonding would be moderated by individually held social expectancies. One hundred twenty undergraduates (75% female) completed an alcohol expectancy measure prior to participation. Participants were primed with either alcohol or neutral beverage words and completed a collaborative group activity followed by questionnaires measuring perceived group cohesion. Several interactions were found between condition and expectancy reflecting that those in the alcohol prime condition with higher social alcohol expectancies reported greater cohesion on task-related, but not emotion-related, group measures. These findings underscore the complexity of the impact of expectancy and social behavior on drinking: the priming of alcohol expectancies may activate aspects of pro-social behavior, which may influence drinking, which in turn may feedback to positively reinforce social expectancies.', '23987193': 'Children with asthma receiving specialty care have been found to have improved asthma outcomes. However, these outcomes can be adversely affected by poor adherence with controller medications.', '23895415': 'Aging is a critical determinant of regenerative capacity in many organ systems, but it remains unresolved in the lung. This study examines murine lung cell dynamics during age-dependent lung regeneration. Proliferation of lung progenitor cells (EpCAM(neg)/Sca-1(high) lung mesenchymal stromal cells - LMSCs, EpCAM(pos)/Sca-1(low) epithelial progenitor cells, proSP-C(pos) alveolar type II epithelial cells - AECII, and CD31(pos) - endothelial cells) was tracked to day 3 or 7 after pneumonectomy (PNX) or SHAM surgery in 3, 9, and 17 month mice. In 3 month mice, post-PNX LMSC proliferation peaked early (3 days), with 50%-80% more BrdU-positive cells than the other cell types, which peaked later (4-7 days). In older mice (9 and 17 month), abundance and post-PNX proliferation of LMSCs at day 3 were reduced (40%-80%). In both young and old mice, LMSCs were isolated and compared phenotypically with whole lung non-LMSCs. Donor age had no qualitative effect on the phenotype (LMSC vs. non-LMSC), with increased expression of CD90/Thy1, CD105/Eng, CD106/Vcam, CD146/Mcam, and Pdgfrα, and up-regulation of mRNA encoding Fap, Eln, Col1a1, Col3a1, Aldh1a3, Arhgef25, Dner, Fgfr1, and Midkine. However, compared with LMSCs isolated from young mice, LMSCs from older mice exhibited reduced mRNA expression of retinoic acid (Aldh1a3, Rbp4), Fgf/Wnt (Fgfr1, Sfrp1, Wnt2, and Ctnnb1), and elastogenesis (Col1a1, Eln, Fbn1, and Sdc2) pathway genes. Isolated LMSCs from older mice also demonstrated lower colony-forming units (-67%), growth potential (-60% by day 7), ALDH activity (-49%), and telomerase activity (-47%). Therefore, age is associated with declining proliferative potential and regenerative functions of LMSCs in the lung.', '24239353': \"Expression of the human Parkinson-disease-associated protein α-synuclein in all Drosophila neurons induces progressive locomotor deficits. Here, we identify a group of 15 dopaminergic neurons per hemisphere in the anterior medial region of the brain whose disruption correlates with climbing impairments in this model. These neurons selectively innervate the horizontal β and β' lobes of the mushroom bodies, and their connections to the Kenyon cells are markedly reduced when they express α-synuclein. Using selective mushroom body drivers, we show that blocking or overstimulating neuronal activity in the β' lobe, but not the β or γ lobes, significantly inhibits negative geotaxis behavior. This suggests that modulation of the mushroom body β' lobes by this dopaminergic pathway is specifically required for an efficient control of startle-induced locomotion in flies.\", '23894544': 'Pollinators provide an important service in many crops. Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are used to supplement pollination services provided by wild bees with the assumption that they will enhance pollination, fruit set and crop yield beyond the levels provided by the wild bees. Recent declines in managed honey bee populations have stimulated interest in finding alternative managed pollinators to service crops. In the eastern U.S., managed hives of the native common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) may be an excellent choice. To examine this issue, a comprehensive 2-yr study was conducted to compare fruit yield and bee visits to flowers in pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) fields that were either supplemented with A. mellifera hives, B. impatiens hives or were not supplemented. We compared pumpkin yield, A. mellifera flower visitation frequency and B. impatiens flower visitation frequency between treatments. Results indicated that supplementing pumpkin fields with either A. mellifera or B. impatiens hives did not increase their visitation to pumpkin flowers or fruit yield compared with those that were not supplemented. Next, the relationship between frequency of pumpkin flower visitation by the most prominent bee species (Peponapis pruinosa (Say), B. impatiens and A. mellifera) and fruit yield was determined across all pumpkin fields sampled. Fruit yield increased as the frequency of flower visits by A. mellifera and B. impatiens increased in 2011 and 2012, respectively. These results suggest that supplementation with managed bees may not improve pumpkin production and that A. mellifera and B. impatiens are important pollinators of pumpkin in our system.', '23942132': 'Chemically functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials for sensing of gases and volatile organic compounds. However, the poor solubility of carbon nanotubes hinders their chemical functionalization and the subsequent integration of these materials into devices. This manuscript describes a solvent-free procedure for rapid prototyping of selective chemiresistors from CNTs and graphite on the surface of paper. This procedure enables fabrication of functional gas sensors from commercially available starting materials in less than 15 min. The first step of this procedure involves the generation of solid composites of CNTs or graphite with small molecule selectors--designed to interact with specific classes of gaseous analytes--by solvent-free mechanical mixing in a ball mill and subsequent compression. The second step involves deposition of chemiresistive sensors by mechanical abrasion of these solid composites onto the surface of paper. Parallel fabrication of multiple chemiresistors from diverse composites rapidly generates cross-reactive arrays capable of sensing and differentiating gases and volatile organic compounds at part-per-million and part-per-thousand concentrations.', '24244731': 'Krüppel-like factors (KLF) and specificity proteins (SP) constitute a family of zinc-finger-containing transcription factors that play important roles in a wide range of processes including differentiation and development of various tissues. The human genome possesses 17 KLF genes (KLF1-KLF17) and nine SP genes (SP1-SP9) with diverse functions. We used sequence similarity searches and gene synteny analysis to identify a new putative KLF gene/pseudogene named KLF18 that is present in most of the placental mammals with sequenced genomes. KLF18 is a chromosomal neighbor of the KLF17 gene and is likely a product of its duplication. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that mammalian predicted KLF18 proteins and KLF17 proteins experienced elevated rates of evolution and are grouped with KLF1/KLF2/KLF4 and non-mammalian KLF17. Predicted KLF18 proteins maintain conserved features in the zinc fingers of the SP/KLF family, while possessing repeats of a unique sequence motif in their N-terminal regions. No expression data have been reported for KLF18, suggesting that it either has highly restricted expression patterns and specialized functions, or could have become a pseudogene in extant placental mammals. Besides KLF18 genes/pseudogenes, we identified several KLF18-like genes such as Zfp352, Zfp352-like, and Zfp353 in the genomes of mouse and rat. These KLF18-like genes do not possess introns inside their coding regions, and gene expression data indicate that some of them may function in early embryonic development. They represent further expansions of KLF members in the murine lineage, most likely resulted from several events of retrotransposition and local gene duplication starting from an ancient spliced mRNA of KLF18.', '23821908': 'Massachusetts health care reform, designed to expand coverage and access to care for vulnerable populations, serves as the model for national health reform in the United States that will be implemented in 2014. Yet, little is known about how the reform may have affected the demand for and the financial performance of safety net hospitals (SNH), the primary source of care for such populations before the reform. Using a quasi-experimental design that included all acute care hospitals in the state, we calculated changes in mean inpatient and outpatient volumes, revenue, and operating margins at SNH from the pre-reform (Fiscal Year 2006) to the post-reform (Fiscal Year 2009) period. We contrasted these changes with contemporaneous changes occurring among non-safety net hospitals (NSNH) using a difference-in-differences approach. We found that SNH in Massachusetts continue to play a disproportionately large role in caring for disadvantaged patients after reform, but that their financial performance has declined considerably compared with NSNH. Ongoing reform efforts in the United States should account for continued SNH demand among the most vulnerable patients and should be designed so as not to undermine the financial stability of SNH that meet this demand.', '23737063': 'Correct host cell recognition is important in the replication cycle for any virus, including bacterial viruses. This essential step should occur before the bacteriophage commits to transfer its genomic material into the host. In this chapter we will discuss the proteins and mechanisms bacteriophages use for receptor recognition (just before full commitment to infection) and nucleic acid injection, which occurs just after commitment. Some bacteriophages use proteins of the capsid proper for host cell recognition, others use specialised spikes or fibres. Usually, several identical recognition events take place, and the information that a suitable host cell has been encountered is somehow transferred to the part of the bacteriophage capsid involved in nucleic acid transfer. The main part of the capsids of bacteriophages stay on the cell surface after transferring their genome, although a few specialised proteins move with the DNA, either forming a conduit, protecting the nucleic acids after transfer and/or functioning in the process of transcription and translation.', '24097114': 'Despite the emergence of sleep apnea (SA) as a significant risk factor for heart failure (HF) mortality, data indicate that SA remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Less well established, though perhaps more emphasized, is the role of sleep apnea in pulmonary hypertension (PH). SA occurs in approximately 50 % of HF patients, and its consequences include intermittent hypoxemia, arousal, and intra-thoracic pressure swings leading to neurohormonal stimulation, oxidative stress and inflammation. While SA is also considered a cause of PH, severe PH due solely to SA is rare. Combining the results of several studies using Swan-Ganz catheters for diagnosis of PH, approximately 10 % of patients with OSA have PH. Effective treatment of SA in HF is associated with improved survival, while treatment of SA in PH is typically associated with modest hemodynamic improvement.', '24216368': 'The use of veterinary pharmaceuticals in beef cattle has led to concerns associated with the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms. Despite the potential negative consequences, data on the transport and mitigation of pharmaceuticals in grazed watersheds with irrigated pasture are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the transport of common beef cattle pharmaceuticals (oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and ivermectin) via surface runoff and leachate from manure amended to grass-vegetated soil boxes under irrigated pasture conditions. The transport of pharmaceuticals from animal manure in surface runoff and soil leachate was relatively low and appears to be limited by desorption and transport of pharmaceuticals entrained in the manure. In surface runoff, less than 4.2% of applied pharmaceuticals in manure (initial concentration: 0.2 mg kg of manure) was detected after 3 wk of irrigation. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface runoff and leachate never exceeded 0.5 μg L. The major portion of pharmaceuticals (up to 99%) was retained in the manure or in the soil directly beneath the manure application site. Based on the minimal transport of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and ivermectin, the risk of significant transport for these targeted beef cattle pharmaceuticals to surface water and groundwater from manure on irrigated pasture appears to be relatively low.', '23161884': 'It is well accepted that TGF-β signaling has critical functional roles in lung development, injury, and repair. We showed previously that null mutation of Smad3, a critical node in the TGF-β pathway, protects mice against fibrosis induced by bleomycin. However, more recently we noticed that abnormal alveolarization also occurs in Smad3-deficient mice and that this is followed by progressive emphysema-like alveolar wall destruction mediated by MMP9. We now know that Smad3 cooperates with c-Jun to synergistically regulate a protein deacetylase SIRT1, by binding to an AP-1 site in the SIRT1 promoter. Consistently, Smad3 knockout lung at postnatal day 28 had reduced SIRT1 expression, which in turn resulted in increased histone acetylation at the binding sites of the transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and Pea3 on the MMP9 promoter, as well as increased acetylation of NF-κB. Thus, upon TGF-β activation, phosphorylated Smad3 can be translocated into the nucleus with Smad4, whereat Smad3 in turn collaborates with c-Jun to activate SIRT1 transcription. SIRT1 can deacetylate NF-κB at lysine 30, as well as histones adjacent to the transcription factor AP-1, NF-κB, and Pea3 binding sites of the MMP9 promoter, thereby suppressing MMP9 transcription, hence fixing MMP9 in the OFF mode. Conversely, when Smad3 is missing, this regulatory pathway is inactivated so that MMP9 is epigenetically turned ON. We postulate that these developmental epigenetic mechanisms by which Smad3 regulates MMP9 transcription cell autonomously may be important in modulating both emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis and that this could explain why both pathologies can appear within the same lung specimen.', '23454248': 'The antilipolytic drug Acipimox reduces free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the blood stream. We examined the effect of reduced FFAs on glucose metabolism in androgen-dependent (CWR22Rv1) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts.', '24006059': 'Protein-protein interaction is an essential biochemical event that mediates various cellular processes including gene expression, intracellular signaling, and intercellular interaction. Understanding such interaction is key to the elucidation of mechanisms of cellular processes in biology and diseases. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α possesses a non-transcriptional activity that competes with c-Myc for Sp1 binding, whereas its isoform HIF-2α lacks Sp1-binding activity due to phosphorylation. Here, we describe the use of in vitro translation to effectively investigate the dynamics of protein-protein interactions among HIF-1α, c-Myc, and Sp1 and to demonstrate protein phosphorylation as a molecular determinant that functionally distinguishes HIF-2α from HIF-1α.', '24127575': 'Signals from the bilateral vestibular labyrinths work in tandem to generate robust estimates of our motion and orientation in the world. The relative contributions of each labyrinth to behavior, as well as how the brain recovers after unilateral peripheral damage, have been characterized for motor reflexes, but never for perceptual functions. Here we measure perceptual deficits in a heading discrimination task following surgical ablation of the neurosensory epithelium in one labyrinth. We found large increases in heading discrimination thresholds and large perceptual biases at 1 wk postlesion. Repeated testing thereafter improved heading perception, but vestibular discrimination thresholds remained elevated 3 mo postlesion. Electrophysiological recordings from the contralateral vestibular and cerebellar nuclei revealed elevated neuronal discrimination thresholds, elevated neurometric-to-psychometric threshold ratios, and reduced trial-by-trial correlations with perceptual decisions [\"choice probabilities\" (CPs)]. The relationship between CP and neuronal threshold was shallower, but not significantly altered, suggesting that smaller CPs in lesioned animals could be largely attributable to greater neuronal thresholds. Simultaneous recordings from pairs of neurons revealed that correlated noise among neurons was also reduced following the lesion. Simulations of a simple pooling model, which takes into account the observed changes in tuning slope and correlated noise, qualitatively accounts for the elevated psychophysical thresholds and neurometric-to-psychometric ratios, as well as the decreased CPs. Thus, cross-labyrinthine interactions appear to play important roles in enhancing neuronal and perceptual sensitivity, strengthening interneuronal correlations, and facilitating correlations between neural activity and perceptual decisions.', '23730758': 'Precopulatory sexual selection is the association between fitness and traits associated with mate acquisition. Although sexual selection is generally recognized to be a powerful evolutionary force, most investigations are limited to characters belonging to individuals. A broader multilevel perspective acknowledges that individual fitness can be affected by aspects of mating success that are characters of groups, such as families. Parental mating success in polygynous or polyandrous human societies may exemplify traits under group-level sexual selection. Using fitness measures that account for age-structure, I measure multilevel selection for mate number over 55 years in a human population with declining rates of polygyny. Sexual selection had three components: individual-level selection for ever-mating (whether an individual mated) and individual- and family-level selection for polyandry and polygyny. Family- and individual-level selection for polygyny was equally strong, three times stronger than family-level selection for polyandry and more than an order of magnitude stronger than individual-level selection for polyandry. However, individual-level selection for polyandry and polygyny was more effective at explaining relative fitness variance than family-level selection. Selection for ever-mating was the most important source of sexual selection for fitness; variation for ever-mating explained 23% of relative fitness variance.', '23537585': 'The cell cycle requires cells to duplicate their chromatin, DNA, and histones, while retaining a subset of epigenetic marks, in a highly coordinated manner. The WEE1 kinase was identified as an important regulator during S phase, preventing entry into mitosis until DNA replication has been completed. Interestingly, WEE1 has also emerged as a key player in regulating histone synthesis. It phosphorylates histone H2B at tyrosine 37 in the nucleosomes found upstream of the histone gene cluster, and this suppresses histone transcription in late S phase. These observations highlight a dual role for WEE1 as both a mitotic gatekeeper and a surveyor of chromatin synthesis, providing a direct link between epigenetics and cell-cycle progression. Importantly, this link has implications for the design of novel epigenetic inhibitors targeting cancers that display elevated expression of this kinase.', '24059876': 'We used a treatment group-only design to pilot test a newly developed intervention to increase condom use among higher risk heterosexually active African American/black male college students. A community-based participatory research partnership developed the intervention called Brothers Leading Healthy Lives. Following an initial screening of 245 men, 81 eligible men were contacted for participation. Of the 64 men who agreed to participate, 57 completed the intervention and 54 of those completed the 3-month follow-up assessment, for a 93% completion rate. Results show significant changes between the baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments in behavioral outcomes, including reductions in unprotected sex, increase in protection during last intercourse, and fewer condom use errors. Most potential mediators (knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and condom use self-efficacy) also changed significantly in the expected direction. These demonstrated changes provide good evidence that men exposed to this intervention will see changes that reduce their risk for HIV.', '25984340': 'Advanced materials that are highly biocompatible and easily modifiable with biomolecules are of great importance for bio-interfacing and the development of biodevices. Here, a biocompatible conducting polymer based nanocomposite was electrochemically synthesized through the electropolymerization of poly(3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) as the only dopant. GO contains many negatively charged carboxyl functional groups and is highly dispersible in aqueous solutions, enabling its facile incorporation and even distribution throughout the conducting polymer. PEDOT/GO films exhibited minimal cytotoxicity after 24 h and supported neuron growth with significantly longer neurites than a control PEDOT/PSS film, indicating that the PEDOT/GO film provides a positive growth signal to developing neurons. While some of the negatively charged functional carboxyl groups of GO \"dope\" the PEDOT, others are exposed freely on the surface of the nanocomposite allowing easy functionalization of the PEDOT/GO composite with biomolecules. Functional laminin peptide, RNIAEIIKDI (p20), was covalently bound to the surface of the PEDOT/GO film and maintained its bioactivity, as evidenced by an increased neurite outgrowth from neurons cultured on the functionalized composite surface. The ease of biomolecule functionalization of the PEDOT/GO nanocomposite, along with its low electrochemical impedance, minimal toxicity and permissiveness to neuron growth, underlines its potential as a material for widespread biosensing, neural interfacing and tissue engineering applications.', '23821515': 'Improving health-related quality of life is an important goal of lung transplantation.

Physical rehabilitation may augment the early improvements in HRQL, whereas bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and psychological conditions have a negative impact.

Following lineage commitment in the embryo, germ cells proliferate, transition into meiosis, and then differentiate into gametes capable of fertilization. In lower organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans, germline stem cells make the decision to proliferate or enter meiosis based in large part on the regulated expression of genes by translational control. This study undertakes a direct characterization of mRNAs that experience translational control and their involvement in similar decisions in the mammalian testis. We previously showed that translation of mRNA encoding the germ cell-specific gene Rhox13 was suppressed in the fetal and neonatal testis. By investigating changes in message utilization during neonatal testis development, we found that a large number of mRNAs encoding both housekeeping and germ cell-specific proteins experience enhanced translational efficiency, rather than increase in abundance, in the testis as quiescent gonocytes transition to mitotic spermatogonia. Our results indicate that translational control is a significant regulator of the germ cell proteome during neonatal testis development.', '24011048': 'Expression of functional, recombinant mammalian proteins often requires expression in mammalian cells (see Single Cell Cloning of a Stable Mammalian Cell Line). If the expressed protein needs to be made frequently, it can be best to generate a stable cell line instead of performing repeated transient transfections into mammalian cells.

In order to secrete proteins for easier purification from the extracellular medium, the coding sequence of recombinant proteins is initially fused to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-mating factor secretion signal leader. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the prepro-region of the α-mating factor secretion signal sequence was performed in order to determine the effects of various deletions and substitutions on expression. Though some mutations clearly dampened protein expression, deletion of amino acids 57-70, corresponding to the predicted 3rd alpha helix of α-mating factor secretion signal, increased secretion of reporter proteins horseradish peroxidase and lipase at least 50% in small-scale cultures. These findings raise the possibility that the secretory efficiency of the leader can be further enhanced in the future.', '23803329': \"Mechanical and neurological couplings exist between musculotendon units of the human hand and digits. Studies have begun to understand how these muscles interact when accomplishing everyday tasks, but there are still unanswered questions regarding the control limitations of individual muscles. Using intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, this study examined subjects' ability to individually initiate and sustain three levels of normalized muscular activity in the index and middle finger muscle compartments of extensor digitorum communis (EDC), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), as well as the extrinsic thumb muscles abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), extensor pollicis longus (EPL), and flexor pollicis longus (FPL). The index and middle finger compartments each sustained activations with significantly different levels of coactivity from the other finger muscle compartments. The middle finger compartment of EDC was the exception. Only two extrinsic thumb muscles, EPL and FPL, were capable of sustaining individual activations from the other thumb muscles, at all tested activity levels. Activation of APL was achieved at 20 and 30% MVC activity levels with significantly different levels of coactivity. Activation of EPB elicited coactivity levels from EPL and APL that were not significantly different. These results suggest that most finger muscle compartments receive unique motor commands, but of the four thumb muscles, only EPL and FPL were capable of individually activating. This work is encouraging for the neural control of prosthetic limbs because these muscles and compartments may potentially serve as additional user inputs to command prostheses.\", '23787752': 'The development of transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions has greatly influenced the manner in which the synthesis of complex organic molecules is approached. A wide variety of methods are now available for the formation of C(sp(2))-C(sp(2)) bonds, and more recent work has focused on the use of C(sp(3)) electrophiles and nucleophiles. The use of secondary and tertiary alkyl nucleophiles in cross-coupling reactions remains a challenge because of the propensity of these alkyl groups to isomerize under the reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a general Pd-catalysed process for the stereoretentive cross-coupling of secondary alkyl azastannatrane nucleophiles with aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides and triflates. Coupling partners with a wide range of electronic characteristics are well tolerated. The reaction occurs with minimal isomerization of the secondary alkyltin nucleophile, and with retention of absolute configuration. This process constitutes the first general method to use secondary alkyltin reagents in cross-coupling reactions.', '24309532': 'Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of acute GVHD. Specifically, we explain how new discoveries in immunology have expanded our understanding of GVHD, in which tissue damage from chemotherapy or radiation results in cytokine release, activating T cells, resulting in proliferation and differentiation, trafficking to target organs, and tissue destruction and inflammation. Insights into the mechanisms of this disease relate directly to the development of preventive strategies and therapies, such as immunosuppression, calcineurin inhibitors, T-cell depletion, CCR5 antagonists, gut decontamination, extracorporeal photopheresis, and more. Understanding the immunobiology of GVHD and developing effective preventions and treatments are critical to the continuing success of AHSCT.', '23938470': 'Kilovoltage intratreatment monitoring (KIM) is a novel real-time localization modality where the tumor position is continuously measured during intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT) by a kilovoltage (kV) x-ray imager. Adding kV imaging during therapy adds radiation dose. The additional effective dose is quantified for prostate radiotherapy and compared to dose from other localization modalities. The software PCXMC 2.0 was used to calculate the effective dose delivered to a phantom as a function of imager angle and field size for a Varian On-Board Imager. The average angular effective dose was calculated for a field size of 6\\xa0cm\\xa0×\\xa06\\xa0cm. The average angular effective dose was used in calculations for different treatment scenarios. Treatment scenarios considered were treatment type and fractionation. For all treatment scenarios, (i.e. conventionally fractionated and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), IMRT and IMAT), the total KIM dose at 1\\xa0Hz ranged from 2-10 mSv. This imaging dose is less than the Navotek radioactive implant dose (64 mSv) and a standard SBRT cone beam computed tomography pretreatment scan dose (22 mSv) over an entire treatment regime. KIM delivers an acceptably low effective dose for daily use as a real-time image-guidance method for prostate radiotherapy.', '24009991': 'Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) can identify key components related to plaque vulnerability but can suffer from artifacts that could prevent accurate identification of lipid rich regions.

We demonstrate that a combined spectral and attenuation model can be used to predict the presence of lipid in OFDI images.', '24357911': 'In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that high contrast images of tooth demineralization can be acquired in the near-IR due to the high transparency of dental enamel. The purpose of this study is to compare the lesion contrast in reflectance at near-IR wavelengths coincident with high water absorption with those in the visible, the near-IR at 1300-nm and with fluorescence measurements for early lesions in occlusal surfaces. Twenty-four human molars were used in this in vitro study. Teeth were painted with an acid-resistant varnish, leaving a 4×4 mm window in the occlusal surface of each tooth exposed for demineralization. Artificial lesions were produced in the exposed windows after 1 & 2-day exposure to a demineralizing solution at pH 4.5. Lesions were imaged using NIR reflectance at 3 wavelengths, 1310, 1460 and 1600-nm using a high definition InGaAs camera. Visible light reflectance, and fluorescence with 405-nm excitation and detection at wavelengths greater than 500-nm were also used to acquire images for comparison. Crossed polarizers were used for reflectance measurements to reduce interference from specular reflectance. The contrast of both the 24 hr and 48 hr lesions were significantly higher (P<0.05) for NIR reflectance imaging at 1460-nm and 1600-nm than it was for NIR reflectance imaging at 1300-nm, visible reflectance imaging, and fluorescence. The results of this study suggest that NIR reflectance measurements at longer near-IR wavelengths coincident with higher water absorption are better suited for imaging early caries lesions.', '23044246': 'To systematically review the literature to determine if health risk behaviors in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are associated with subsequent symptom burden or level of functioning.', '24076756': 'Acinic cell carcinoma is a rare salivary neoplasm that is generally associated with a good prognosis, although a subset of patients develops local and distant recurrences.

One method to estimate capacitance is to inject current pulses into a neuron and fit the resulting changes in membrane potential with multiple exponentials; if the neuron is purely passive, the amplitude and time constant of the slowest exponential give neuron capacitance (Major G, Evans JD, Jack JJ. Biophys J 65: 423-449, 1993). Golowasch et al. (Golowasch J, Thomas G, Taylor AL, Patel A, Pineda A, Khalil C, Nadim F. J Neurophysiol 102: 2161-2175, 2009) have shown that this is the best method for measuring the capacitance of nonisopotential (i.e., most) neurons. However, prior work has not tested for, or examined how much error would be introduced by, slow voltage-dependent phenomena possibly present at the membrane potentials typically used in such work. We investigated this issue in lobster (Panulirus interruptus) stomatogastric neurons by performing current clamp-based capacitance measurements at multiple membrane potentials. A slow, voltage-dependent phenomenon consistent with residual voltage-dependent conductances was present at all tested membrane potentials (-95 to -35 mV). This phenomenon was the slowest component of the neuron's voltage response, and failure to recognize and exclude it would lead to capacitance overestimates of several hundredfold. Most methods of estimating capacitance depend on the absence of voltage-dependent phenomena. Our demonstration that such phenomena make nonnegligible contributions to neuron responses even at well-hyperpolarized membrane potentials highlights the critical importance of checking for such phenomena in all work measuring neuron capacitance. We show here how to identify such phenomena and minimize their contaminating influence.\", '23436372': 'Histone lysine and arginine methylation involved in gene activation and silencing is dynamically regulated. However, partly limited to the research technologies previously available, the dynamics of global histone methylation on a site-specific basis have not been fully pursued. Heavy methyl-SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Cell Culture) labeling provides a remarkable signpost to distinguish the preexisting and newly generated methyl marks on histones. Using this technology coupled with quantitative LC-MS analysis make it possible to monitor changes in the dynamics of histone site-specific methylation. In this chapter, we comprehensively describe the experimental strategy to determine the dynamics of multiple histone methylated residues including SILAC labeling, histone extraction/purification and mass spectrometry analysis.', '22618119': 'Research and theory suggest rape supportive attitudes are important predictors of sexual assault; yet, to date, rape supportive attitudes have been assessed through self-report measures that are methodologically and theoretically limited. To address these limitations, the objectives of the current project were to: (1) develop a novel implicit rape attitude assessment that captures automatic attitudes about rape and does not rely on self-reports, and (2) examine the association between automatic rape attitudes and sexual assault perpetration. We predicted that automatic rape attitudes would be a significant unique predictor of sexual assault even when self-reported rape attitudes (i.e., rape myth acceptance and hostility toward women) were controlled. We tested the generalizability of this prediction in two independent samples: a sample of undergraduate college men (n\\xa0=\\xa075, M age\\xa0=\\xa019.3\\xa0years) and a sample of men from the community (n\\xa0=\\xa050, M age\\xa0=\\xa035.9\\xa0years). We found the novel implicit rape attitude assessment was significantly associated with the frequency of sexual assault perpetration in both samples and contributed unique variance in explaining sexual assault beyond rape myth acceptance and hostility toward women. We discuss the ways in which future research on automatic rape attitudes may significantly advance measurement and theory aimed at understanding and preventing sexual assault.', '23841571': 'To examine the demographic, physical, and mental health characteristics; current drug use patterns; motivations for use; and diversion sources among elderly prescription opioid misusers.', '24342470': 'Oral fluid (OF) testing is a less-invasive alternative to blood-based testing for HIV.

Indeed, it is possible that stimulation of local neovascularization upon transplantation could improve functional graft outcomes. In the present study, we investigate the use of multilayered alginate microbeads to provide a sustained delivery of FGF-1, and whether this results in increased neovascularization in vivo. Multilayered alginate microbeads, loaded with either 150ng or 600ng of FGF-1 in the outer layer, were surgically implanted into rats using an omentum pouch model and compared to empty microbead implants. Rats were sacrificed at 4days, 1week, and 6weeks. Staining for CD31 showed that both conditions of FGF-1 loaded microbeads resulted in a significantly higher vessel density at all time points studied. Moreover, at 6weeks, alginate microbeads containing 600ng FGF-1 provided a greater vascular density compared to both the control group and the microbeads loaded with 150ng FGF-1. Omenta analyzed via staining for smooth muscle alpha actin showed no variation in mural cell density at either 4days or 1week. At 6weeks, however, omenta exposed to microbeads loaded with 600ng FGF-1 showed an increase in mural cell staining compared to controls. These results suggest that the sustained delivery of FGF-1 from multilayered alginate microbeads results in a rapid and persistent vascular response. An increase in the local blood supply could reduce the number of islets required for transplantation in order to achieve clinical efficacy.', '23806554': 'A series of 3-aryl-3-arylmethoxy-azetidines were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinities at dopamine and serotonin transporters.

Mice deficient in PIMT accumulate isoAsp-containing proteins, resulting in cognitive deficits, abnormal neuronal physiology and cytoarchitecture, and fatal epileptic seizures 30-60 days after birth. Synapsins I and II, dynamin-1, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and α/β-tubulin are major targets of PIMT in brain. To investigate links between isoAsp accumulation and the neurological phenotype of the KO mice, we used Western blotting to compare patterns of in vivo phosphorylation or acetylation of the major PIMT targets listed above. Phosphorylations of synapsins I and II at Ser-9 were increased in female KO vs. WT mice, and acetylation of tubulin at Lys-40 was decreased in male KO vs. WT mice. Average levels of dynamin-1 phosphorylation at Ser-778 and Ser-795 were higher in male KO vs. WT mice, but the statistical significance (P>0.1) was low. No changes in phosphorylation were found in synapsins I and II at Ser-603, in CRMP2 at Ser-522 or Thr-514, in DARPP-32 at Thr-34, or in PDK1 at Ser-241. General levels of phosphorylation assessed with Pro-Q Diamond stain, or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, appeared similar in the WT and KO mice. We conclude that isoAsp accumulation is associated with altered functional status of several neuronal proteins that are highly susceptible to this type of damage. We also uncovered unexpected differences in how male and female mice respond to isoAsp accumulation in the brain.', '23421800': 'This paper advises caution in relation to the increasing interest in molecular-genetic association studies in developmental psychology based on a set of empirical examples from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) that highlight the fragility of effects reported in the literature on the molecular-genetic correlates of infant attachment. Specifically, this paper updates and provides three extensions to results reported in Luijk et al. (2011), which recently failed to replicate evidence from smaller-sample studies that a set of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and oxytonergic markers are significantly associated with infant attachment security or disorganization. First, we report here that the average effect of \"usual suspect\" polymorphisms on infant attachment security and disorganization in the SECCYD is approximately zero. Second, because Luijk et al. (2011) reported data based exclusively on the White infants in the SECCYD, this paper reveals that the average effect of polymorphisms featured in this literature is also of trivial magnitude in the non-White sub-sample (cf. Chen, Barth, Johnson, Gotlib, & Johnson, 2011). Third, this paper attempts, but fails, to replicate a recent finding by Raby et al.

We previously reported that BBA could reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). In the present study, we investigated whether BBA has the potential to reverse multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7/ABCC10)-mediated MDR. We found that BBA concentration-dependently enhanced the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine. Accumulation and efflux experiments demonstrated that BBA increased the intracellular accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel by inhibiting the efflux of [(3)H]-paclitaxel from HEK293/MRP7 cells. In addition, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses indicated no significant alteration of MRP7 protein expression and localization in plasma membranes after treatment with BBA. These results demonstrate that BBA reverses MRP7-mediated MDR through blocking the drug efflux function of MRP7 without affecting the intracellular ATP levels. Our findings suggest that BBA has the potential to be used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents to augment the response to chemotherapy.\", '23316445': 'Levels of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) can be altered by the formation and hydrolysis of IAA conjugates. The isolation and characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with reduced IAA-conjugate sensitivity and wild-type IAA responses is advancing the understanding of auxin homeostasis by uncovering the factors needed for conjugate metabolism. For example, the discovery that the IAA-Ala-resistant mutant iar1 is defective in a protein in the ZIP family of metal transporters uncovered a link between metal homeostasis and IAA-conjugate sensitivity. To uncover additional factors impacting auxin conjugate metabolism, we conducted a genetic modifier screen and isolated extragenic mutations that restored IAA-amino acid conjugate sensitivity to the iar1 mutant. One of these suppressor mutants is defective in a putative cation diffusion facilitator, MTP5 (At3g12100; formerly known as MTPc2). Loss of MTP5 function restored IAA conjugate sensitivity to iar1 but not to mutants defective in IAA-amino acid conjugate amidohydrolases. Our results are consistent with a model in which MTP5 and IAR1 transport metals in an antagonistic fashion to regulate metal homeostasis within the subcellular compartment in which the IAA-conjugate amidohydrolases reside, and support previous suggestions that the ion composition in this compartment influences hydrolase activity.', '23420882': 'The complement system is involved in a range of diverse developmental processes, including cell survival, growth, differentiation, and regeneration. However, little is known about the role of complement in embryogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate a novel role for the canonical complement 5a receptor (C5aR) in the development of the mammalian neural tube under conditions of maternal dietary folic acid deficiency. Specifically, we found C5aR and C5 to be expressed throughout the period of neurulation in wild-type mice and localized the expression to the cephalic regions of the developing neural tube. C5aR was also found to be expressed in the neuroepithelium of early human embryos. Ablation of the C5ar1 gene or the administration of a specific C5aR peptide antagonist to folic acid-deficient pregnant mice resulted in a high prevalence of severe anterior neural tube defect-associated congenital malformations. These findings provide a new and compelling insight into the role of the complement system during mammalian embryonic development.', '22149471': \"Cartilage exhibits nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour. Various models have been proposed to explain cartilage stress relaxation, but it is unclear whether explicit modelling of fluid flow in unconfined compression is needed. This study compared Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model with a stretched-exponential model of cartilage stress relaxation and examined each of these models both alone and in combination with a fluid-flow model in unconfined compression. Cartilage explants were harvested from bovine calf patellofemoral joints and equilibrated in tissue culture for 5 days before stress-relaxation testing in unconfined compression at 5% nominal strain. The stretched exponential models fit as well as the QLV models. Furthermore, the average stretched exponential relaxation time determined by this model lies within the range of experimentally measured relaxation times for extracted proteoglycan aggregates, consistent with the hypothesis that the stretched exponential model represents polymeric mechanisms of cartilage viscoelasticity.\", '22905875': 'Among the most replicated results in social cognition is the split between explicit and implicit attitudes; adults demonstrate weaker group-based preferences on explicit rather than implicit measures. However, the developmental origins of this pattern remain unclear. If implicit attitudes develop over a protracted period of time, children should not demonstrate the implicit preferences observed among adults. Additionally, unlike adults, children may report group-based preferences due to their lesser concern with social desirability. In Study 1, Christian adults showed the expected pattern of robust implicit preference but no explicit preference. In 4 additional experiments, 6- to 8-year-old children whose parents identified them as Christian viewed characters described as belonging to 2 starkly different religious groups (\"strong religious difference\") or 2 relatively similar religious groups (\"weak religious difference\"). Participants then completed explicit and implicit (IAT) measures of attitude toward Christians and either Hindus (Study 2) or Jews (Studies 3-5). Three main results emerged. First, like adults, children showed significant implicit pro-Christian preferences across all studies. Second, unlike adults, children in the \"strong religious difference\" case reported preferences of approximately the same magnitude as their implicit attitudes (i.e., no dissociation). Third, even in the \"weak religious difference\" case, children showed implicit pro-Christian preferences (although, like adults, their explicit attitudes were not sensitive to intergroup difference). These data suggest that the seeds of implicit religious preferences are sown early and that children\\'s explicit preferences are influenced by the social distance between groups.', '24353478': \"Evidence for approximate number system (ANS) representations in infancy is robust but has typically only been found when infants are presented with arrays of four or more elements. In addition, several studies have found that infants fail to discriminate between small numbers when continuous variables such as surface area and contour length are controlled. These findings suggest that under some circumstances, infants fail to recruit either the ANS or object file representations for small sets. Here, we used a numerical change detection paradigm to assess 6-month-old infants' ability to represent small values. In Experiment 1, infants were tested with 1 versus 3, 1 versus 2, and 2 versus 3 dots. Infants successfully discriminated 1 versus 3 and 1 versus 2, but failed with 2 versus 3. In Experiment 2, we tested whether infants could compare small and large values with a 2 versus 4 condition. Across both experiments, infants' performance exhibited ratio dependence, the hallmark of the ANS. Our results indicate that infants can attend to the purely numerical attributes of small sets and that the numerical change detection paradigm accesses ANS representations in infancy regardless of set size.\", '24343437': 'To overcome the intensive light scattering in biological tissue, diffuse optical tomography (DOT) in the near-infrared range for breast lesion detection is usually combined with other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, x-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging, to provide guidance. However, these guiding imaging modalities may depend on different contrast mechanisms compared to the optical contrast in the DOT. As a result, they cannot provide reliable guidance for DOT because some lesions may not be detectable by a nonoptical modality but may have a high optical contrast. An imaging modality that relies on optical contrast to provide guidance is desirable for DOT. We present a system that combines a frequency-domain DOT and real-time photoacoustic tomography (PAT) systems to detect and characterize deeply seated targets embedded in a turbid medium. To further improve the contrast, the exogenous contrast agent, indocyanine green (ICG), is used. Our experimental results show that the combined system can detect a tumor-mimicking phantom, which is immersed in intralipid solution with the concentrations ranging from 100 to 10 μM and with the dimensions of 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm × 0.6 cm, up to 2.5 cm in depth. Mice experiments also confirmed that the combined system can detect tumors and monitor the ICG uptake and washout in the tumor region. This method can potentially improve the accuracy to detect small breast lesions as well as lesions that are sensitive to background tissue changes, such as the lesions located just above the chest wall.', '23956799': 'There is now a large body of evidence demonstrating that fluid mechanical forces generated by blood flowing through the vasculature play a direct role in regulating endothelial cell structure and function. Integrin receptors that localize to the basal surface of the endothelium participate in both outside-in and inside-out signaling events that influence endothelial gene expression and morphology in response to flow. Our analyses of apical plasma membranes derived from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells revealed that integrins are also expressed on this cell surface. Here, we tested whether these integrins participate in mechanotransduction events that are known to occur on the endothelial cell luminal/apical membrane. We found that apically expressed β1 integrins are rapidly activated in response to acute shear stress. Blockade of β1 integrin activation attenuated a shear-induced signaling cascade involving Src-family kinase, PI3-kinase, Akt and eNOS on this cell surface. In addition, β1 integrin activation and associated signaling events were dependent on the structural integrity of caveolae but not the actin cytoskeleton. Taken together, these data indicate that endothelial responses to shear stress are mediated by spatially distinct pools of integrins.', '23876529': 'Reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) are fluorescent proteins whose fluorescence, upon excitation at a certain wavelength, can be switched on or off by light in a reversible manner.

This review will describe research on the mechanisms of reversible photoswitching and recent applications using RSFPs. While cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore is believed to be the general mechanism for most RSFPs, structural studies reveal diversity in the details of photoswitching mechanisms, including different effects of protonation, chromophore planarity, and pocket flexibility.

Locations of these dipoles were then estimated using gradient descent within five template head models fit to the electrode positions. These were: a spherical model, three-layer and four-layer BEM head models based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template head image, and these BEM models warped to the recorded electrode positions. Smallest localization errors (4.1-6.2\\xa0mm, medians) were obtained using the electrode-position warped four-layer BEM models, with largest localization errors (~20\\xa0mm) for most basal brain locations. When we increased the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio assumed in the template model scalp projections from the simulated value (25:1) to a higher value (80:1) used in earlier studies, the estimated dipole locations moved outwards (12.4\\xa0mm, median). We also investigated the effects of errors in co-registering the electrode positions, of reducing electrode counts, and of adding a fifth, isotropic white matter layer to one individual head model.

A key contribution of the work is the establishment of a procedure to implement a matched forward and backprojection operator pair associated with the discrete imaging model, which permits application of a wide-range of modern image reconstruction algorithms that can mitigate the effects of data incompleteness and noise. The forward and backprojection operators are based on the k-space pseudospectral method for computing numerical solutions to the PA wave equation in the time domain.

For the best-studied case, ocular dominance plasticity in primary visual cortex in response to monocular deprivation (MD), the maturation of inhibition is necessary and sufficient. How does inhibition open the CP? We present a theory: the transition from pre-CP to CP plasticity arises because inhibition preferentially suppresses responses to spontaneous relative to visually driven input activity, switching learning cues from internal to external sources. This differs from previous proposals in (1) arguing that the CP can open without changes in plasticity mechanisms when activity patterns become more sensitive to sensory experience through circuit development, and (2) explaining not simply a transition from no plasticity to plasticity, but a change in outcome of MD-induced plasticity from pre-CP to CP.

Both in zebrafish and mammalian cells, loss of Rer1p resulted in the shortening of cilium and impairment of its motile or sensory function, which was reflected by hearing, vision, and left-right asymmetry defects as well as decreased Hedgehog signaling. We further demonstrate that Rer1p depletion reduced ciliary length and function by increasing γ-secretase complex assembly and activity and, consequently, enhancing Notch signaling as well as reducing Foxj1a expression.', '23723360': 'The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of CYP3A5 expression on inhibitory potency (Ki or IC50 values) of CYP3A inhibitors, using recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5) and CYP3A5 genotyped human liver microsomes (HLMs). IC50 ratios between rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5 (rCYP3A5/rCYP3A4) of ketoconazole (KTZ) and itraconazole (ITZ) were 8.5 and 8.8 for midazolam (MDZ), 4.7 and 9.1 for testosterone (TST), 1.3 and 2.8 for terfenadine, and 0.6 and 1.7 for vincristine, respectively, suggesting substrate- and inhibitor-dependent selectivity of the two azoles. Due to the difference in the IC50 values for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, nonconcordant expression of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein can significantly affect the observed magnitude of CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans. Indeed, the IC50 values of KTZ and ITZ for CYP3A-catalyzed MDZ and TST metabolism were significantly higher in HLMs with CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 genotypes than in HLMs with the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype, showing CYP3A5 expression-dependent IC50 values. Moreover, when IC50 values of KTZ and ITZ for different HLMs were kinetically simulated based on CYP3A5 expression level and enzyme-specific IC50 values, a good correlation between the simulated and the experimentally measured IC50 values was observed. Further simulation analysis revealed that both the Ki ratio (for inhibitors) and Vmax/Km ratio (for substrates) between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were major factors for CYP3A5 expression-dependent IC50 values. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that CYP3A5 genotype and expression level have a significant impact on inhibitory potency for CYP3A-catalyzed drug metabolism, but that the magnitude of its effect is inhibitor-substrate pair specific.', '23550545': 'Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a new promising strategy to eradicate pathogenic microorganisms such as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The search for new approaches that can kill bacteria but do not induce the appearance of undesired drug-resistant strains suggests that PDT may have advantages over traditional antibiotic therapy. PDT is a non-thermal photochemical reaction that involves the simultaneous presence of visible light, oxygen and a dye or photosensitizer (PS). Several PS have been studied for their ability to bind to bacteria and efficiently generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon photo-stimulation. ROS are formed through type I or II mechanisms and may inactivate several classes of microbial cells including Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are typically characterized by an impermeable outer cell membrane that contains endotoxins and blocks antibiotics, dyes, and detergents, protecting the sensitive inner membrane and cell wall. This review covers significant peer-reviewed articles together with US and World patents that were filed within the past few years and that relate to the eradication of Gram-negative bacteria via PDI or PDT. It is organized mainly according to the nature of the PS involved and includes natural or synthetic food dyes; cationic dyes such as methylene blue and toluidine blue; tetrapyrrole derivatives such as phthalocyanines, chlorins, porphyrins, chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll derivatives; functionalized fullerenes; nanoparticles combined with different PS; other formulations designed to target PS to bacteria; photoactive materials and surfaces; conjugates between PS and polycationic polymers or antibodies; and permeabilizing agents such as EDTA, PMNP and CaCl₂.

These γ-glutamylamines can be released from proteins by proteases in an intact form. The free γ-glutamylamines can be catabolized to 5-oxo-L-proline and the free amine by γ-glutamylamine cyclotransferase. Free γ-glutamylamines, however, accumulate in the CSF and affected areas of Huntington Disease brain. This observation suggests transglutaminase-derived γ-glutamylamines may play a more significant role in neurodegeneration than previously thought. The following monograph reviews the metabolism of γ-glutamylamines and examines the possibility that these species contribute to neurodegeneration.', '23894224': \"The performance of pattern recognition based myoelectric control has seen significant interest in the research community for many years. Due to a recent surge in the development of dexterous prosthetic devices, determining the clinical viability of multifunction myoelectric control has become paramount. Several factors contribute to differences between offline classification accuracy and clinical usability, but the overriding theme is that the variability of the elicited patterns increases greatly during functional use. Proportional control has been shown to greatly improve the usability of conventional myoelectric control systems. Typically, a measure of the amplitude of the electromyogram (a rectified and smoothed version) is used to dictate the velocity of control of a device. The discriminatory power of myoelectric pattern classifiers, however, is also largely based on amplitude features of the electromyogram. This work presents an introductory look at the effect of contraction strength and proportional control on pattern recognition based control. These effects are investigated using typical pattern recognition data collection methods as well as a real-time position tracking test. Training with dynamically force varying contractions and appropriate gain selection is shown to significantly improve (p<0.001) the classifier's performance and tolerance to proportional control.\", '23290195': 'To study the effects of noninvasive transcranial focal electrical stimulation (TFS) via tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCRE) on the electrographic and behavioral activity from pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in rats.', '23630352': 'Earlier, we had demonstrated that treatment with low dose of GM-CSF can prevent the development of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and type 1 diabetes, and could also reverse ongoing EAT and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. The protective effect was mediated through the induction of tolerogenic CD11C(+)CD8α(-) dendritic cells (DCs) and consequent expansion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). Subsequently, we showed that GM-CSF acted specifically on bone marrow precursors and facilitated their differentiation into tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs; GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived DCs [GM-BMDCs]), which directed Treg expansion in a contact-dependent manner. This novel mechanism of Treg expansion was independent of TCR-mediated signaling but required exogenous IL-2 and cosignaling from DC-bound OX40L. In this study, we observed that OX40L-mediated signaling by GM-BMDCs, although necessary, was not sufficient for Treg expansion and required signaling by Jagged1. Concurrent signaling induced by OX40L and Jagged1 via OX40 and Notch3 receptors expressed on Tregs was essential for the Treg expansion with sustained FoxP3 expression. Adoptive transfer of only OX40L(+)Jagged1(+) BMDCs led to Treg expansion, increased production of IL-4 and IL-10, and suppression of EAT in the recipient mice. These results showed a critical role for OX40L- and Jagged1-induced cosignaling in GM-BMDC-induced Treg expansion.', '23499601': 'The test-negative design has emerged in recent years as the preferred method for estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in observational studies. However, the methodologic basis of this design has not been formally developed.', '23940548': 'Disease control is of paramount importance in public health, with infectious disease extinction as the ultimate goal. Although diseases may go extinct due to random loss of effective contacts where the infection is transmitted to new susceptible individuals, the time to extinction in the absence of control may be prohibitively long. Intervention controls are typically defined on a deterministic schedule. In reality, however, such policies are administered as a random process, while still possessing a mean period. Here, we consider the effect of randomly distributed intervention as disease control on large finite populations. We show explicitly how intervention control, based on mean period and treatment fraction, modulates the average extinction times as a function of population size and rate of infection spread. In particular, our results show an exponential improvement in extinction times even though the controls are implemented using a random Poisson distribution. Finally, we discover those parameter regimes where random treatment yields an exponential improvement in extinction times over the application of strictly periodic intervention. The implication of our results is discussed in light of the availability of limited resources for control.', '22711643': 'Non-contrast-enhanced MR angiography is a promising alternative to the established contrast-enhanced approach as it reduces patient discomfort and examination costs and avoids the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Inflow-sensitive slab-selective inversion recovery imaging has been used with great promise, particularly for abdominal applications, but has limited craniocaudal coverage due to inflow time constraints. In this work, a new non-contrast-enhanced MR angiography method using velocity-selective inversion preparation is developed and applied to renal and abdominal angiography. Based on the excitation k-space formalism and Shinnar-Le-Roux transform, a velocity-selective excitation pulse is designed that inverts stationary tissues and venous blood while preserving inferiorly flowing arterial blood. As the magnetization of the arterial blood in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries is well preserved during the magnetization preparation, artery visualization over a large abdominal field of view is achievable with an inversion delay time that is chosen for optimal background suppression. Healthy volunteer tests demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the extent of visible arteries compared with the slab-selective approach, covering renal arteries through iliac arteries over a craniocaudal field of view of 340 mm.', '23819662': 'Integrated into the work in health systems strengthening (HSS) is a growing focus on the importance of ensuring quality of the services delivered and systems which support them.

Method Between 1999 and 2008 all pregnant Norwegian women were eligible for recruitment into the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers were asked to report on their use of paracetamol at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. We used data on 48 631 children whose mothers returned the 3-year follow-up questionnaire by May 2011. Within this sample were 2919 same-sex sibling pairs who were used to adjust for familial and genetic factors. We modelled psychomotor development (communication, fine and gross motor development), externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, and temperament (emotionality, activity, sociability and shyness) based on prenatal paracetamol exposure using generalized linear regression, adjusting for a number of factors, including febrile illness, infections and co-medication use during pregnancy.', '23781876': 'Biostimulation of groundwater microbial communities (e.g., with carbon sources) is a common approach to achieving in situ bioremediation of organic pollutants (e.g., explosives). We monitored a field-scale approach to remediate the explosive RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) in an aquifer near the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant in Middletown, IA. The purpose of the study was to gain insight into the effect of biostimulation on the microbial community. Biostimulation with acetate led to the onset of RDX reduction at the site, which was most apparent in monitoring well MW309. Based on previous laboratory experiments, we hypothesized that RDX degradation and metabolite production would correspond to enrichment of one or more Fe(III)-reducing bacterial species. Community DNA from MW309 was analyzed with 454 pyrosequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Production of RDX metabolites corresponded to a microbial community shift from primarily Fe(III)-reducing Betaproteobacteria to a community dominated by Fe(III)-reducing Deltaproteobacteria (Geobacteraceae in particular) and Bacteroidetes taxa. This data provides a firsthand field-scale microbial ecology context to in situ RDX bioremediation using modern sequencing techniques that will inform future biostimulation applications.', '23317647': 'Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor that arises from immature neuroblasts of the sympathetic nervous system. Krüpple-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor, the precise function of which in neuroblastoma is unclear. We examined the effects of KLF4 overexpression and apigenin (APG) treatment in human malignant neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cell lines. KLF4 overexpression in both SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cell lines was confirmed by laser scanning immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and Western blotting. We found that 100 nM KLF4 plasmid and 25 μM APG synergistically inhibited the growth of SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cells. We also found increase in KLF4 expression in response to treatment with various concentrations of APG. Combination of KLF4 plasmid and APG treatment significantly increased the amounts of apoptosis in both cell lines when compared with control vector or single treatment. We also noticed that the combination therapy decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, increased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Noxa, and Puma, upregulated p53, and caused activation of caspase-3 for cleavage of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) leading to completion of apoptosis machinery. Further, combination of KLF4 overexpression and APG treatment was highly effective in inhibiting migration of both neuroblastoma cell lines and was associated with down regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. Collectively, our results from this investigation strongly suggest that KLF4 functions as a tumor suppressor and potentiates the anti-cancer activities of APG in two different human malignant neuroblastoma cell lines.', '23522082': 'The Michaelis-Menten equation, proposed a century ago, describes the kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions.

Thinning of corpus callosum is the neuroradiological distinctive sign frequently associated with white matter abnormalities. The causative gene, ZFYVE26, encodes a large protein of 2539 amino acid residues, termed spastizin, containing three recognizable domains: a zinc finger, a leucine zipper and a FYVE domain. Spastizin protein has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and co-localizes partially with early endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules and vesicles involved in protein trafficking. In addition, spastizin localizes to the mid-body during the final step of mitosis and contributes to successful cytokinesis. Spastizin interacts with Beclin 1, a protein required for cytokinesis and autophagy, which is the major lysosome-mediated degradation process in the cell. In view of the Beclin 1-spastizin interaction, we investigated the possible role of spastizin in autophagy. We carried out this analysis by using lymphoblast and fibroblast cells derived from four different spastizin mutated patients (p.I508N, p.L243P, p.R1209fsX, p.S1312X) and from control subjects. Of note, the truncating p.R1209fsX and p.S1312X mutations lead to loss of spastizin protein. The results obtained indicate that spastizin interacts with the autophagy related Beclin 1-UVRAG-Rubicon multiprotein complex and is required for autophagosome maturation. In cells lacking spastizin or with mutated forms of the protein, spastizin interaction with Beclin 1 is lost although the formation of the Beclin 1-UVRAG-Rubicon complex can still be observed. However, in these cells we demonstrate an impairment of autophagosome maturation and an accumulation of immature autophagosomes. Autophagy defects with autophagosome accumulation can be observed also in neuronal cells upon spastizin silencing. These results indicate that autophagy is a central process in the pathogenesis of complicated forms of hereditary spastic paraparesis with thin corpus callosum.', '23465091': 'The modular TRAPP complexes act as nucleotide exchangers to activate the Golgi Ypt/Rab GTPases, Ypt1 and Ypt31/Ypt32. In yeast, TRAPP I acts at the cis-Golgi and its assembly and structure are well characterized. In contrast, TRAPP II acts at the trans-Golgi and is poorly understood. Especially puzzling is the role of Trs20, an essential TRAPP I/II subunit required neither for the assembly of TRAPP I nor for its Ypt1-exchange activity. Mutations in Sedlin, the human functional ortholog of Trs20, cause the cartilage-specific disorder SEDT. Here we show that Trs20 interacts with the TRAPP II-specific subunit Trs120. Furthermore, the Trs20-Trs120 interaction is required for assembly of TRAPP II and for its Ypt32-exchange activity. Finally, Trs20-D46Y, with a single-residue substitution equivalent to a SEDT-causing mutation in Sedlin, interacts with TRAPP I, but the resulting TRAPP complex cannot interact with Trs120 and TRAPP II cannot be assembled. These results indicate that Trs20 is crucial for assembly of TRAPP II, and the defective assembly caused by a SEDT-linked mutation suggests that this role is conserved.', '23910071': 'The aim of this study was to describe population-based patterns of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related emergency department (ED) visits.', '23678882': 'To promote clinical and patient oriented research, as part of the Second International ALS Conference in Tarrytown, NY, USA, seven pairs of clinicians and scientists were asked to lead discussions with meeting attendees on six major topics (one of which was discussed by two groups); each one the focus of a 90-min Breakout Session. Approximately 25 meeting attendees participated in each session. The Breakout Sessions considered six major themes: 1) Approaches to encourage clinicians to engage in more clinical research to discover the pathogenesis and cause of ALS; 2) Exploring avenues to build more effective partnerships between basic scientists and ALS physicians; 3) Increasing patient interest and commitment to participating in non-trial clinical research; 4) Brainstorming about factors that are most critical to the discovery of the pathogenesis and cause of ALS; 5) Finding ways to incorporate clinical research projects into clinical trials; and 6) Developing state-of-the-art epidemiological studies to solve the mystery of ALS.

NrrF, a trans-acting sRNA in Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been shown in the meningococcus to control indirectly, in response to iron (Fe) availability, the transcription of genes encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, a Fe-requiring enzyme. Given that in other organisms, sRNAs target multiple mRNAs to control gene expression, we used a global approach to examine the role of NrrF in controlling gonococcal transcription. Three strains, including N. gonorrhoeae FA1090, an nrrF deletion mutant, and a complemented derivative, were examined using a custom CombiMatrix microarray to assess the role of this sRNA in controlling gene expression in response to Fe availability. In the absence of NrrF, the mRNA half-lives for 12 genes under Fe-depleted growth conditions were longer than those in FA1090.

Panitumumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular binding domain of EGFR, is increasingly used with radiotherapy and chemotherapy but has associated toxicities. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a novel targeted imaging agent for the EGFR using radiolabeled panitumumab. Flow cytometry studies were performed to evaluate EGFR expression in several cell lines. Desferrioxamine-Bz-NCS (DFO) was conjugated to panitumumab and labeled with (89)Zr. Cell uptake studies were performed in four cell lines. For biodistribution studies and micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), mouse xenograft models were generated using the same cell lines. PET was performed, and tumors and select organs were harvested for biodistribution studies. Panitumumab was radiolabeled with (89)Zr with high radiochemical purity and specific activity and was found to be stable in serum. Cell binding studies demonstrated that radiotracer uptake in cells correlated with the degree of EGFR expression. MicroPET/CT imaging studies demonstrated a high intensity of (89)Zr-panitumumab in A431 and HCT 116 tumors in comparison with the EGFR-negative tumors. Biodistribution studies confirmed the results from the imaging studies.

Genome-wide association studies link ORM (yeast)-Like protein isoform 3 [corrected] (ORMDL3), a member of the ORM gene family, to nonallergic childhood-onset asthma. Orm proteins negatively regulate sphingolipid (SL) synthesis by acting as homeostatic regulators of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo SL synthesis, but it is not known how SPT activity or SL synthesis is related to asthma. The present study analyzes the effect of decreased de novo SL synthesis in the lung on airway reactivity after administration of myriocin, an inhibitor of SPT, and in SPT heterozygous knockout mice. We show that, in both models, decreased de novo SL synthesis increases bronchial reactivity in the absence of inflammation. Decreased SPT activity affected intracellular magnesium homeostasis and altered the bronchial sensitivity to magnesium. This functionally links decreased de novo SL synthesis to asthma and so identifies this metabolic pathway as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.', '23830534': 'Preventative health services, including herpes zoster vaccination rates, remain low despite known benefits.

Introduction of early revascularization strategies and mechanical ventricular support have seen short-term mortality associated with CS fall from 70% to 80% in the 1970s to approximately 50% to 60% in the 1990s. Previous studies reported a higher incidence of CS after AMI in women (11.6% vs 8.3%). The aims of this study were to determine hospital mortality outcomes and gender differences following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in the setting of CS. Data were collected prospectively among all patients undergoing PPCI for AMI at a large UK tertiary cardiac center between April 2008 and October 2011. A sample of 2,864 patients (women: 844 [29.5%]) underwent PPCI, of which 141 (4.9%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CS. Eighty-one of 2,019 [4.0%] male patients (mean age: 64.2 years) and 60 of 844 [7.1%]) female patients (mean age: 69.9 years) with CS underwent PPCI (p <0.001). The overall hospital mortality was 35.5% with no gender difference (male: 35.8% vs female: 35%, p >0.99). In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that in the contemporary PPCI era, there is a reduction in the incidence of CS with reduced hospital mortality rates and no gender difference. The absence of a gender difference is remarkable because higher proportions of women presented with CS and were older than their male counterparts. Long-term follow-up data are required to determine if this difference is sustained.', '23722710': 'Fluctuating forces imposed on the airway smooth muscle due to breathing are believed to regulate hyperresponsiveness in vivo. However, recent animal and human isolated airway studies have shown that typical breathing-sized transmural pressure (Ptm) oscillations around a fixed mean are ineffective at mitigating airway constriction. To help understand this discrepancy, we hypothesized that Ptm oscillations capable of producing the same degree of bronchodilation as observed in airway smooth muscle strip studies requires imposition of strains larger than those expected to occur in vivo. First, we applied increasingly larger amplitude Ptm oscillations to a statically constricted airway from a Ptm simulating normal functional residual capacity of 5 cmH2O. Tidal-like oscillations (5-10 cmH2O) imposed 4.9 ± 2.0% strain and resulted in 11.6 ± 4.8% recovery, while Ptm oscillations simulating a deep inspiration at every breath (5-30 cmH2O) achieved 62.9 ± 12.1% recovery. These same Ptm oscillations were then applied starting from a Ptm = 1 cmH2O, resulting in approximately double the strain for each oscillation amplitude. When extreme strains were imposed, we observed full recovery. On combining the two data sets, we found a linear relationship between strain and resultant recovery. Finally, we compared the impact of Ptm oscillations before and after constriction to Ptm oscillations applied only after constriction and found that both loading conditions had a similar effect on narrowing. We conclude that, while sufficiently large strains applied to the airway wall are capable of producing substantial bronchodilation, the Ptm oscillations necessary to achieve those strains are not expected to occur in vivo.', '24040154': 'LaeA is a fungal specific virulence factor of both plant and human pathogenic fungi. Transcriptional profiles of laeA mutants have been successfully exploited to identify regulatory mechanisms of secondary metabolism in fungi; here we use laeA mutants as tools to elucidate virulence attributes in Aspergillus flavus. Microarray expression profiles of ΔlaeA and over-expression laeA (OE::laeA) were compared to wild type A. flavus. Strikingly, several nitrogen metabolism genes are oppositely mis-regulated in the ΔlaeA and OE::laeA mutants. One of the nitrogen regulatory genes, the bZIP encoding meaB, is up-regulated in ΔlaeA. Significantly, over-expression of meaB (OE::meaB) phenocopies the decreased virulence attributes of a ΔlaeA phenotype including decreased colonization of host seed, reduced lipase activity and loss of aflatoxin B1 production in seed. However, a double knock-down of laeA and meaB (KD::laeA,meaB) demonstrated that KD::laeA,meaB closely resembled ΔlaeA rather than wild type or ΔmeaB in growth, aflatoxin biosynthesis and sclerotia production thus suggesting that meaB does not contribute to the ΔlaeA phenotype. MeaB and LaeA appear to be part of regulatory networks that allow them to have both shared and distinct roles in fungal biology.', '24074152': 'A convenient method for the direct construction of quaternary carbons from tertiary alcohols by visible-light photoredox coupling of tert-alkyl N-phthalimidoyl oxalate intermediates with electron-deficient alkenes is reported.', '23307825': 'Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens.

Biogenesis of the Golgi during cell division occurs through a sophisticated disassembly and reassembly process that can be divided into three distinct but cooperative steps, including the deformation and reformation of the Golgi cisternae, stacks, and ribbon. Here, we review our current understanding of the protein machineries that control these three steps in the cycle of mammalian cell division: GRASP65 and GRASP55 in Golgi stack and ribbon formation; ubiquitin and AAA ATPases in postmitotic Golgi membrane fusion; and golgins and cytoskeleton in Golgi ribbon formation.', '23621614': 'Human endometrial endothelial cell (HEEC) innate immunity remains poorly characterized.

Other cinnamon species, C. cassia, C. loureiroi, and C. burmannii, commonly known as cassia, are also sold in the U.S. as cinnamon. In the present study, coumarin and other marker compounds were analyzed in authenticated cinnamon bark samples as well as locally bought cinnamon samples, cinnamon-flavored foods, and cinnamon-based food supplements using a validated UPLC-UV/MS method. The experimental results indicated that C. verum bark contained only traces of coumarin, whereas barks from all three cassia species, especially C. loureiroi and C. burmannii, contained substantial amounts of coumarin. These species could be potential sources of coumarin in cinnamon-flavored food in the U.S. Coumarin was detected in all locally bought cinnamon, cinnamon-flavored foods, and cinnamon food supplements.

However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unclear. The present study used a depression model of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) and pain models for spontaneous pain (i.e., the formalin test) and acute evoked pain (i.e., noxious thermal stimulation) in rats. The activity of neurons within thalamo-cortical circuits in the lateral and medial pain pathways was recorded by a multiple-channel recording technique, and behaviors were observed simultaneously. The results confirmed our previous findings that rats exposed to UCMS tended to exhibit decreased pain sensitivity to experimental stimuli but increased behavioral responses to ongoing pain. Based on the analysis of single-unit responses, the results demonstrated that the processing of spontaneous vs. evoked pain in a depressive-like state was altered in the opposite direction (activation vs. inhibition). The ensemble encoding analysis revealed that exposure to UCMS gave rise to enhanced inter-regional functional connectivity in spontaneous pain processing, but did not influence that of evoked pain. In addition, different brain activation patterns underlying the processing of spontaneous vs. evoked pain were observed. These findings revealed that the distinct response patterns of neurons within the pain-related brain circuits, especially in the affective pain pathway, mediate the divergent effects of depression on spontaneous vs. evoked pain. This is also the first report on the electrophysiology of depression models that provides direct evidence that the effect of depression on spontaneous and evoked pain may involve different brain mechanisms.', '24187427': 'As it remains practically impossible to generate ergodic ensembles for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it becomes critical to compare spectroscopic characteristics of the theoretically generated ensembles to corresponding measurements. We develop a Bayesian framework to infer the ensemble properties of an IDP using a combination of conformations generated by MD simulations and its measured infrared spectrum. We performed 100 different MD simulations totaling more than 10 µs to characterize the conformational ensemble of αsynuclein, a prototypical IDP, in water. These conformations are clustered based on solvent accessibility and helical content. We compute the amide-I band for these clusters and predict the thermodynamic weights of each cluster given the measured amide-I band. Bayesian analysis produces a reproducible and non-redundant set of thermodynamic weights for each cluster, which can then be used to calculate the ensemble properties. In a rigorous validation, these weights reproduce measured chemical shifts.', '23919580': 'This study examined potential self-selection bias in a large pregnancy cohort by comparing exposure-outcome associations from the cohort to similar associations obtained from nationwide registry data.

SjS affects 2-4 million people in the US alone and greatly affects the life quality of the afflicted individuals. Autoreactive effector T cells are central executors and orchestrators in the pathogenic processes of SjS by mediating target organ inflammation and destruction and by facilitating B cell responses and autoantibody production. A variety of cytokines that are produced by effector T cells or capable of directly affecting effector T cells are elevated in the target organs and circulations of SjS patients. The recent advancement in the understanding about the functions of these cytokines, achieved by using both human samples and mouse disease models, has generated great insights into the cytokine control of autoimmune responses in the SjS disease setting. In this review, we summarized the recent findings on the expression and functions of cytokines in this disease, with specific focus on those derived from T cells and/or directly affecting T cell responses.\", '23700432': 'Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a plasma membrane channel glycoprotein that plays a role in innate immune response through association with the inflammasome complex. Probenecid, a classic pharmacological agent for gout, has also been used historically in combination therapy with antibiotics to prevent cellular drug efflux and has been reported to inhibit Panx1. As the inflammasome has been implicated in the progression of Chlamydia infections, and with chlamydial infections at record levels in the US, we therefore investigated whether probenecid would have a direct effect on Chlamydia trachomatis development through inhibition of Panx1. We found chlamydial development to be inhibited in a dose-dependent, yet reversible manner in the presence of probenecid. Drug treatment induced an aberrant chlamydial morphology consistent with persistent bodies. Although Panx1 was shown to localize to the chlamydial inclusion, no difference was seen in chlamydial development during infection of cells derived from wild-type and Panx1 knockout mice. Therefore, probenecid may inhibit C. trachomatis growth by an as yet unresolved mechanism.', '23570734': 'We investigated the development of weighting strategies for acoustic cues by examining the morphology of the N1-P2 auditory evoked potential (AEP) to changes in amplitude rise time (ART) and rate of formant transition (RFT) of consonant-vowel (CV) pairs in 4-6-year olds and adults. In the AEP session, individuals listened passively to the CVs /ba/, /wa/, and a /ba/ with a superimposed slower-rising /wa/ envelope (/ba/(wa)). In the behavioral session, individuals listened to the same stimuli and judged whether they heard a /ba/ or /wa/. We hypothesized that a developmental shift in weighting strategies should be reflected in a change in the morphology of the N1-P2 AEP. In 6-year olds and adults, the N1-P2 amplitude at the vertex reflected a change in RFT but not in ART. In contrast, in the 4-5-year olds, the vertex N1-P2 did not show specificity to changes in ART or RFT. In all groups, the N1-P2 amplitude at channel C4 (right hemisphere) reflected a change in ART but not in RFT. Behaviorally, 6-year olds and adults predominately utilized RFT cues (classified /ba/(wa) as /ba/) during phonetic judgments, as opposed to 4-5-year olds which utilized both cues equally. Our findings suggest that both ART and RFT are encoded in the auditory cortex, but an N1-P2 shift toward the vertex following age 4-5 indicates a shift toward an adult-like weighting strategy, such that, to utilize RFT to a greater extent.', '23258502': 'Pericardial effusion is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

SFA from young (4 months) and old (24 months) Fischer 344 rats were cannulated for examination of endothelium-dependent [flow or acetylcholine (ACh)] and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] vasodilator function. To determine the mechanism by which aging affected vasodilation to flow and ACh, vasodilator responses were assessed in the presence of N (ω)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, to inhibit NOS), LY-294002 (to inhibit PI3K), or 1L6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerocarbonate (AktI, to inhibit Akt). Flow- and ACh-induced vasodilator responses were significantly impaired in old SFA, whereas endothelium-independent dilation to SNP was not compromised. Age-group differences in flow- and ACh-induced dilations were abolished in the presence of L-NNA, LY-294002, or AktI. In a separate experiment, SFA were cannulated and stimulated with ACh (10(-4) M, 3 min), flow (60 μl/min, 5 min), or remained unstimulated (3 min). SFA were removed from the pipettes and immunoblot analysis was used to assess ACh- and flow-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS on ser(1177). Stimulation with ACh or flow increased phosphorylation of eNOS on ser(1177) in young (not old) SFA. Preincubation of young SFA with LY-294002, abolished the ACh-induced phosphorylation of eNOS in young SFA. Collectively, these results indicate that impaired NO-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation in old SFA is due, in part, to an impaired potential for PI3K/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS on ser(1177).', '23762562': 'AP1 (jun/fos) transcription factors (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) are key regulators of epidermal keratinocyte survival and differentiation and important drivers of cancer development. Understanding the role of these factors in epidermis is complicated by the fact that each protein is expressed, at different levels, in multiple cells layers in differentiating epidermis, and because AP1 transcription factors regulate competing processes (i.e., proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation). Various in vivo genetic approaches have been used to study these proteins including targeted and conditional knockdown, overexpression, and expression of dominant-negative inactivating AP1 transcription factors in epidermis. Taken together, these studies suggest that individual AP1 transcription factors have different functions in the epidermis and in cancer development and that altering AP1 transcription factor function in the basal versus suprabasal layers differentially influences the epidermal differentiation response and disease and cancer development.', '23494570': 'Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs link public transfers to human capital investment in the hopes of alleviating current poverty and reducing its intergenerational transmission.

Nearly one third of the world's population has active or latent disease, resulting in 1.5 million deaths annually. Central nervous system involvement, while rare, is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Manifestations include tuberculoma and tuberculous meningitis, with the majority of cases occurring in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite advancements in imaging and laboratory diagnostics, tuberculomas of the central nervous system remain a diagnostic challenge due to their insidious nature and nonspecific findings. On imaging studies tuberculous meningitis is characterized by diffuse basal enhancement, but tuberculomas may be indistinguishable from neoplasms. Early diagnosis is imperative, since clinical outcomes are largely dependent on timely treatment. Stereotactic biopsy with histopathological analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis, but is only recommended when non-invasive methods are inconclusive. Standard medical treatment includes rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol. In cases of drug resistance, revision of the treatment regimen with second-line agents is recommended over the addition of a single drug to the first-line regimen. Advances in genomics have identified virulent strains of tuberculosis and are improving our understanding of host susceptibility.

Data for this study came from a longitudinal evaluation of Multisystemic Therapy (MST) provided by licensed MST provider organizations in community settings. Outcome variables included mid-treatment levels of caregiver report of therapist adherence, changes in caregiver report of therapist adherence over the course of treatment, and overall levels of caregiver-therapist and youth-therapist emotional bond. Hypothesized predictors included race\\\\ethnicity and levels of poly-substance use, externalizing behavior, and youth self-report of delinquency early in treatment as well as pre-treatment number of arrests. Participants were 185 adolescents (M age = 15.35, SD = 1.29) and their caregivers. Of the participating youth, 48 % self-identified as Caucasian, 20 % as African-American, 28 % as Hispanic\\\\Latino, and 4 % as \"other.\" Two-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses revealed that for Caucasian youth, lower rates of self-reported delinquency were associated with greater increases in caregiver report of therapist adherence over the course of MST. For His-panic\\\\Latino caregivers, higher externalizing behavior and poly-substance use were associated with reports of lower therapist adherence at mid-treatment and poorer overall levels of emotional bonding with therapists. In contrast, for African-American participants, higher levels of youth externalizing behavior and poly-substance use were associated with higher overall levels of caregiver and youth report of emotional bonding with therapists, respectively.

However, little is known concerning the response of the brain to increased dietary Se under conditions of Se sufficiency, despite the majority of Se supplementation trials occurring in healthy, Se sufficient subjects. We evaluated the transcriptional response of Se-dependent genes, selenoproteins and the genes necessary for their synthesis (the selenoproteome), in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain to supplementation with nutritionally relevant levels of dietary Se (sodium selenite) during conditions of assumed Se sufficiency. We first used a microarray approach to analyze the response of the brain selenoproteome to dietary Se supplementation for 14 days and then assessed the immediacy and time-scale transcriptional response of the brain selenoproteome to 1, 7, and 14 days of Se supplementation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The microarray approach did not indicate large-scale influences of Se on the brain transcriptome as a whole or the selenoproteome specifically; only one nonselenoproteome gene (si:ch73-44m9.2) was significantly differentially expressed. Our qRT-PCR results, however, indicate that increases of dietary Se cause small, but significant transcriptional changes within the brain selenoproteome, even after only 1 day of supplementation. These responses were dynamic over a short period of supplementation in a manner highly dependent on sex and the duration of Se supplementation. In nutritional intervention studies, it may be necessary to utilize methods such as qRT-PCR, which allow larger sample sizes, for detecting subtle transcriptional changes in the brain.', '23940684': 'Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as one of the most important pathogens both in health care and community-onset infections. The prerequisite for methicillin resistance is mecA, which encodes a β-lactam-insensitive penicillin binding protein PBP2a. A characteristic of MRSA strains from hospital and community associated infections is their heterogeneous expression of resistance to β-lactam (HeR) in which only a small portion (≤ 0.1%) of the population expresses resistance to oxacillin (OXA) ≥ 10 µg/ml, while in other isolates, most of the population expresses resistance to a high level (homotypic resistance, HoR). The mechanism associated with heterogeneous expression requires both increase expression of mecA and a mutational event that involved the triggering of a β-lactam-mediated SOS response and related lexA and recA genes. In the present study we investigated the cellular physiology of HeR-MRSA strains during the process of β-lactam-mediated HeR/HoR selection at sub-inhibitory concentrations by using a combinatorial approach of microarray analyses and global biochemical profiling employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to investigate changes in metabolic pathways and the metabolome associated with β-lactam-mediated HeR/HoR selection in clinically relevant heterogeneous MRSA. We found unique features present in the oxacillin-selected SA13011-HoR derivative when compared to the corresponding SA13011-HeR parental strain that included significant increases in tricarboxyl citric acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and a concomitant decrease in fermentative pathways. Inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme cis-aconitase gene in the SA13011-HeR strain abolished β-lactam-mediated HeR/HoR selection demonstrating the significance of altered TCA cycle activity during the HeR/HoR selection. These results provide evidence of both the metabolic cost and the adaptation that HeR-MRSA clinical strains undergo when exposed to β-lactam pressure, indicating that the energy production is redirected to supply the cell wall synthesis/metabolism, which in turn contributes to the survival response in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics.', '23224237': 'Aspects of reproductive history are among the most well-established breast cancer risk factors. However, relatively little is known about how they influence risk of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, particularly among younger women. Using data from a population-based case-control study of women 20-44 years of age, we assessed the relationships between various reproductive factors and risk of estrogen receptor positive (ER+), triple-negative, and HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Detailed reproductive histories were obtained through structured interviewer administered in-person questionnaires. Reproductive histories among control women (n = 941) were compared to those of ER+ cases (n = 781), triple-negative cases (n = 180), and HER2-overexpressing cases (n = 60) using polytomous logistic regression. Age at menarche, parity, and number of full-term pregnancies were similarly associated with risk of all three breast cancer subtypes. In contrast, age at first live birth, the interval between age at menarche and age at first birth, and breastfeeding were inversely associated with risk of triple-negative breast cancer (P values for trend 0.002, 0.006 and 0.018, respectively), but were not associated with risk of ER+ or HER2-overexpressing cancers. A strong inverse association between breastfeeding and risk of triple-negative breast cancer has now been consistently observed across numerous studies, and at present it is the most well-established protective factor for this aggressive and lethal form of breast cancer. Further studies clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying this relationship and confirming our results with respect to age at first birth and the interval between age at menarche and age at first birth are needed.', '23651936': \"Community-Based Participatory research (CBPR) introduces new ethical challenges for HIV prevention studies in low-resource international settings.

The results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) addressing this problem are controversial, and new genetic concepts have been fostered to advance the progress in the field. A limitation of GWAS and new genetic concepts is that they do not thoroughly address specifics of aging-related traits. Integration of theoretical concepts in genetics and aging research with empirical evidence from different disciplines highlights the conceptual problems in studies of genetic origin of aging-related traits. To address these problems, novel approaches of systemic nature are required. These approaches should adopt the non-deterministic nature of linkage of genes with aging-related traits and, consequently, reinforce research strategies for improving our understanding of mechanisms shaping genetic effects on these traits. Investigation of mechanisms will help determine conditions that activate specific genetic variants or profiles and explore to what extent these conditions that shape genetic effects are conserved across human lives and generations.', '24143261': 'Mitochondria are essential organelles that harbor a reduced genome, and expression of that genome requires regulated metabolism of its transcriptome by nuclear-encoded proteins. Despite extensive investigation, a comprehensive map of the yeast mitochondrial transcriptome has not been developed and all of the RNA-metabolizing proteins have not been identified, both of which are prerequisites to elucidating the basic RNA biology of mitochondria. Here, we present a mitochondrial transcriptome map of the yeast S288C reference strain. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, we show the expression level of all transcripts, revise all promoter, origin of replication, and tRNA annotations, and demonstrate for the first time the existence of alternative splicing, mirror RNAs, and a novel RNA processing site in yeast mitochondria. The transcriptome map has revealed new aspects of mitochondrial RNA biology and we expect it will serve as a valuable resource. As a complement to the map, we present our compilation of all known yeast nuclear-encoded ribonucleases (RNases), and a screen of this dataset for those that are imported into mitochondria. We sought to identify RNases that are refractory to recovery in traditional mitochondrial screens due to an essential function or eclipsed accumulation in another cellular compartment. Using this in silico approach, the essential RNase of the nuclear and cytoplasmic exosome, Dis3p, emerges as a strong candidate. Bioinformatics and in vivo analyses show that Dis3p has a conserved and functional mitochondrial-targeting signal (MTS). A clean and marker-less chromosomal deletion of the Dis3p MTS results in a defect in the decay of intron and mirror RNAs, thus revealing a role for Dis3p in mitochondrial RNA decay.', '23555761': 'FOXO1 is involved in glucocorticoid- and sepsis-induced muscle wasting, in part reflecting regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Mechanisms influencing FOXO1 expression in muscle wasting are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) upregulates muscle FOXO1 expression and activity with a downstream upregulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression during sepsis and glucocorticoid treatment and that inhibition of PPARβ/δ activity can prevent muscle wasting. We found that activation of PPARβ/δ in cultured myotubes increased FOXO1 activity, atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression, protein degradation and myotube atrophy. Treatment of myotubes with dexamethasone increased PPARβ/δ expression and activity. Dexamethasone-induced FOXO1 activation and atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression, protein degradation, and myotube atrophy were inhibited by PPARβ/δ blocker or siRNA. Importantly, muscle wasting induced in rats by dexamethasone or sepsis was prevented by treatment with a PPARβ/δ inhibitor. The present results suggest that PPARβ/δ regulates FOXO1 activation in glucocorticoid- and sepsis-induced muscle wasting and that treatment with a PPARβ/δ inhibitor may ameliorate loss of muscle mass in these conditions.', '24251083': \"Due to toxicities associated with their malignancies and treatments, adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer (AYASCC) are at high risk for developing chronic diseases. This can be compounded by a greater prevalence of unhealthy behaviors relative to similarly aged non-cancer peers. Disparities in health behaviors have been noted for Black and Hispanic AYASCC, but data on Asian American (AA) or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) minorities are lacking. The purpose of this study was to help bridge these information gaps by gathering data from Hawai'i AA and NHOPI AYSCC. Telephone surveys were used to collect health behavior data from survivors 13-24 years of age (N=64); 55% of the sample was female, 77% AA or NHOPI, 63% leukemia/lymphoma survivors, and 32% overweight/obese. These were compared to state/national survey data for similarly aged individuals (Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data for 13-17 year olds, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for 18-24 year olds). While Hawai'i AYASCC had significantly lower rates of tobacco/alcohol use, a higher proportion did not eat five fruits/vegetables a day (96%) compared to state (83%) and national (78%) samples (P < .001). Although many met age-specific physical activity recommendations, 44% of <18 year olds and 29% of ≥18 year olds still failed to meet national guidelines. Low intake of fruits/vegetables and suboptimal levels of physical activity place these vulnerable, ethnic minority cancer survivors at higher risk for chronic disease.

Aequorin reacts with Ca(2+) via oxidation of the prosthetic group, coelenterazine, which results in emission of light. This signal can be detected by using a special luminescence reader (called aequorinometer) or luminescence plate readers. Here we describe the main characteristics of aequorin as a Ca(2+) probe and how to measure Ca(2+) in different intracellular compartments of animal cells (cytosol, different mitochondrial districts, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes and subplasma-membrane cytosol), ranging from single-well analyses to high-throughput screening by transfecting animal cells using DNA vectors carrying recombinant aequorin chimeras. The use of aequorin mutants and modified versions of coelenterazione increases the range of calcium concentrations that can be recorded. Cell culture and transfection takes ∼3 d.

The MTB's active motility combined with magnetotaxism (their ability to swim following the magnetic field direction) offer new possibilities for the delivery of drugs to tumors. Many tumor microenvironment parameters such as the malformed angiogenesis capillaries, the heterogeneous blood flow, and the high interstitial pressure affect the delivery of blood-borne drugs to the tumor. Microorganisms used as microcarriers might be helpful in bypassing these limitations while helping to uniformly distribute the drug in the targeted area. Since the angiogenesis network of blood vessels that the tumors recruit is highly disorganized and unpredictable, the magnetic control method adopted account for these parameters to achieve targeting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a microchannel network offering a complex pattern considered as a worst-case navigation situation. Besides targeted drug delivery to tumor sites using bacterial carrier, aggregation of microorganisms is required for micromanipulation and microassembly.\", '24003649': 'Our genome is the blueprint for our bodies.

In mammals there are four paralogous ANT genes, of which ANT4 is exclusively expressed in meiotic germ cells. Since ANT4 has been shown essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice, inhibition of ANT4 appears to be a reasonable target for male contraceptive development. Further, in contrast to ANT1, ANT2 and ANT3 that are highly homologous to each other, ANT4 has a distinguishable amino acid sequence, which serves as a basis to develop a selective ANT4 inhibitor. In this study, we aimed to identify candidate compounds that can selectively inhibit ANT4 activity over the other ANTs. We used a structure-based method in which ANT4 was modeled then utilized as the basis for selection of compounds that interact with sites unique to ANT4. A large chemical library (>100,000 small molecules) was screened by molecular docking and effects of these compounds on ADP/ATP exchange through ANT4 were examined using yeast mitochondria expressing human ANT4. Through this, we identified one particular candidate compound, [2,2'-methanediylbis(4-nitrophenol)], which inhibits ANT4 activity with a lower IC50 than the other ANTs (5.8 μM, 4.1 μM, 5.1 μM and 1.4 μM for ANT1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively).

In the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the single PLK homologue TbPLK is necessary for the assembly of a series of essential organelles that position and adhere the flagellum to the cell surface. Previous work relied on RNA interference or inhibitors of undefined specificity to inhibit TbPLK, both of which have significant experimental limitations. Here we use an analogue-sensitive approach to selectively and acutely inhibit TbPLK. T. brucei cells expressing only analogue-sensitive TbPLK (TbPLK(as)) grow normally, but upon treatment with inhibitor develop defects in flagellar attachment and cytokinesis. TbPLK cannot migrate effectively when inhibited and remains trapped in the posterior of the cell throughout the cell cycle. Using synchronized cells, we show that active TbPLK is a direct requirement for the assembly and extension of the flagellum attachment zone, which adheres the flagellum to the cell surface, and for the rotation of the duplicated basal bodies, which positions the new flagellum so that it can extend without impinging on the old flagellum. This approach should be applicable to the many kinases found in the T. brucei genome that lack an ascribed function.', '23601673': \"Different components of executive function such as working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility can be dissociated behaviorally and mechanistically; however, the within-subject influences of normal aging on different aspects of executive function remain ill-defined. To better define these relationships, young adult and aged male F344 rats were cross-characterized on an attentional set-shifting task that assesses cognitive flexibility and a delayed response task that assesses working memory. Across tasks, aged rats were impaired relative to young; however, there was significant variability in individual performance within the aged cohort. Notably, performance on the set-shifting task and performance at long delays on the delayed response task were inversely related among aged rats. Additional experiments showed no relationship between aged rats' performance on the set-shifting task and performance on a hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory task.

The molecular cycle requires rhythmic phosphorylation of PER and TIM proteins, which is mediated by several kinases and phosphatases such as Protein Phosphatase-2A (PP2A) and Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP1). Here, we used mass spectrometry to identify 35 \"phospho-occupied\" serine/threonine residues within PER, 24 of which are specifically regulated by PP1/PP2A. We found that cell culture assays were not good predictors of protein function in flies and so we generated per transgenes carrying phosphorylation site mutations and tested for rescue of the per(01) arrhythmic phenotype. Surprisingly, most transgenes restore wild type rhythms despite carrying mutations in several phosphorylation sites. One particular transgene, in which T610 and S613 are mutated to alanine, restores daily rhythmicity, but dramatically lengthens the period to ~ 30 hrs. Interestingly, the single S613A mutation extends the period by 2-3 hours, while the single T610A mutation has a minimal effect, suggesting these phospho-residues cooperate to control period length. Conservation of S613 from flies to humans suggests that it possesses a critical clock function, and mutational analysis of residues surrounding T610/S613 implicates the entire region in determining circadian period. Biochemical and immunohistochemical data indicate defects in overall phosphorylation and altered timely degradation of PER carrying the double or single S613A mutation(s). The PER-T610A/S613A mutant also alters CLK phosphorylation and CLK-mediated output. Lastly, we show that a mutation at a previously identified site, S596, is largely epistatic to S613A, suggesting that S613 negatively regulates phosphorylation at S596. Together these data establish functional significance for a new domain of PER, demonstrate that cooperativity between phosphorylation sites maintains PER function, and support a model in which specific phosphorylated regions regulate others to control circadian period.', '23948901': \"A key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies is the progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. In the present study, we use transgenic Drosophila melanogaster as a model to analyze in vivo the effect of expressing pseudophosphorylated tau (S199E/T212E/T231E/S262E tau) on pathological human tau (PH-tau) and on the FTDP-17 mutant R406W (PH-tauR406W). We used two different inducers that produced different levels of tau expression. The expression of these forms of tau did not significantly affect the lifespan of the flies. Flies expressing PH-tau displayed a clear locomotor dysfunction compared to those expressing normal tau regardless of the level of expression. At lower level of expression, this pathological phenotype was found to be age-dependent. At 35 days old, PH-tau flies showed the strongest locomotor impairment compare to flies expressing human tau or control flies (46%, 18% and 18% of flies remained on the bottom of the vials, respectively). At higher levels of expression, PH-tau flies showed these defects at seven days of age and the dysfunction also became significant for flies expressing tauR406W and PH-tauR406W. Whole brain immunochemistry analysis revealed that PH-tau as well as PH-tauR406W appeared to have abnormal mushroom body structures, critical structures involved in olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila. Severe olfactory learning deficits were induced by the expression of PH-tau. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PH-tau induced a toxic effect in Drosophila, as flies develop both an abnormal motor deficit, associated with disruption of the mushroom body neurons, and impaired olfactory learning.\", '23139361': 'We examined the impact of arousal state, sex, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the magnitude of progressive augmentation of the hypoxic ventilatory response and ventilatory long-term facilitation (vLTF). We also examined whether exposure to intermittent hypoxia during sleep has an impact on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in individuals with OSA. Ten men and seven women with OSA, along with ten healthy men and ten healthy women, were exposed to twelve 2-min episodes of hypoxia (end-tidal PO(2): 50 Torr) in the presence of sustained hypercapnia (end-tidal PCO(2): 3 Torr above baseline), followed by a 30-min recovery period during wakefulness and sleep. The OSA participants completed an additional sham study during sleep. The AHI during the first hour of sleep following the intermittent hypoxia and sham protocols were compared. Progressive augmentation was only evident during wakefulness and was enhanced in the OSA participants. vLTF was evident during wakefulness and sleep. When standardized to baseline, vLTF was greater during wakefulness and was enhanced in the OSA group (men: wakefulness 1.39 ± 0.08 vs. sleep 1.14 ± 0.03; women: wakefulness 1.35 ± 0.03 vs. sleep 1.16 ± 0.05 fraction of baseline; P ≤ 0.001) compared with control (men: wakefulness 1.19 ± 0.03 vs. sleep 1.09 ± 0.03; women: wakefulness 1.26 ± 0.05 vs. sleep 1.08 ± 0.04 fraction of baseline; P ≤ 0.001). The AHI following exposure to intermittent hypoxia was increased (intermittent hypoxia 72.8 ± 7.3 vs. sham 56.5 ± 7.0 events/h; P ≤ 0.01). Sex-related differences were not observed for the primary measures. We conclude that progressive augmentation is not evident, and the magnitude of vLTF is diminished during sleep compared with wakefulness in men and women. However, when present, the phenomena are enhanced in individuals with OSA. The AHI data indicate that, under the prevailing experimental conditions, vLTF did not serve to mitigate apnea severity.', '23148782': 'Although an attentional bias for threat-relevant cues has been theorized in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to date empirical demonstration of this phenomenon has been at best inconsistent. Furthermore, the nature of this bias in PTSD has not been clearly delineated. In the present study, veterans with PTSD (n = 20), trauma-exposed veterans without PTSD (n = 16), and healthy nonveteran controls (n = 22) completed an emotional attentional blink task that measures the extent to which emotional stimuli capture and hold attention. Participants searched for a target embedded within a series of rapidly presented images. Critically, a combat-related, disgust, positive, or neutral distracter image appeared 200 ms, 400 ms, 600 ms, or 800 ms before the target. Impaired target detection was observed among veterans with PTSD relative to both veterans without PTSD and healthy nonveteran controls after only combat-related threat distracters when presented 200 ms, 400 ms, or 600 ms before the target, indicating increased attentional capture by cues of war and difficulty disengaging from such cues for an extended period. Veterans without PTSD and healthy nonveteran controls did not significantly differ from each other in target detection accuracy after combat-related threat distracters. These data support the presence of an attentional bias toward combat related stimuli in PTSD that should be a focus of treatment efforts.', '22750525': 'Depression is a significant and impairing mood disorder with onset possible as early as age 3 and into adulthood. Given this varying pattern of age of onset, identifying the relationship between brain development and depression across the lifespan has proven elusive. This review identifies some of the factors that may have limited the advancement of our knowledge in this area and discusses how synthesizing established models of depression and normative brain development may help to overcome them. More specifically, it is suggested that current neurobiological models of depression fail to account for the developmental variance associated with early neural network development and the potential influence of experience on this process. The utility of applying an established framework of normative brain development to this topic is described and its potential utility for conceptualizing the influence of depression on brain function across the life span is addressed. Future directions including longitudinal neuroimaging studies of early onset depression and groups at risk for this disorder are proposed.', '23708369': 'Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In\\xa0this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and\\xa03), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to\\xa0describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the specific effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way.', '23489952': 'Recent studies have suggested the biomechanical subtasks of walking can be produced by a reduced set of co-excited muscles or modules. Individuals post-stroke often exhibit poor inter-muscular coordination characterized by poor timing and merging of modules that are normally independent in healthy individuals. However, whether locomotor therapy can influence module composition and timing and whether these improvements lead to improved walking performance is unclear. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of a locomotor rehabilitation therapy on module composition and timing and post-stroke hemiparetic walking performance. Twenty-seven post-stroke hemiparetic subjects participated in a 12-week locomotor intervention incorporating treadmill training with body weight support and manual trainers accompanied by training overground walking. Electromyography (EMG), kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected from subjects both pre- and post-therapy and from 19 age-matched healthy controls walking on an instrumented treadmill at their self-selected speed. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify the module composition and timing from the EMG data. Module timing and composition, and various measures of walking performance were compared pre- and post-therapy. In subjects with four modules pre- and post-therapy, locomotor training resulted in improved timing of the ankle plantarflexor module and a more extended paretic leg angle that allowed the subjects to walk faster and with more symmetrical propulsion. In addition, subjects with three modules pre-therapy increased their number of modules and improved walking performance post-therapy. Thus, locomotor training has the potential to influence module composition and timing, which can lead to improvements walking performance.', '23859532': 'To evaluate the operative and pathologic outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men with progressive changes in body mass index (BMI) category.', '23725221': \"Our previous research (Pediatrics 2010:126) found a strong association between caregiver oral health literacy (OHL) and children's oral health status; however, we found a weak association with oral health behaviors (OHBs).

The precise role of collagen VI is not clearly defined although it is most abundant in the interstitial matrix of tissues and often found in close association with basement membranes. Three genetically distinct collagen VI chains, α1(VI), α2(VI) and α3(VI), encoded by the COL6A1. COL6A2 and COL6A3 genes, were first described more than 20 years ago. Their molecular assembly and role in congenital muscular dystrophy has been broadly characterized. In 2008, three additional collagen VI genes arrayed in tandem at a single gene locus on chromosome 3q in humans, and chromosome 9 in mice, were described. Following the naming scheme for collagens the new genes were designated COL6A4. COL6A5 and COL6A6 encoding the α4(VI), α5(VI) and α6(VI) chains, respectively.

The computer program simulates a wide range of neuronal behavior in its six lessons: i) Resting Membrane Potential, ii) Membrane Time Constant, iii) Membrane Length Constant, iv) Axon Action Potential, v) Axon Voltage Clamp, and vi) Synaptic Potential. The program is designed foremost as a platform for conducting neurophysiology experiments in silico. Neuronal parameters are easily modified and a virtual stimulator injects single or double current pulses into the neuron. Phenomena such as temporal summation of synaptic potentials, passive spread of a synaptic potential from the dendrite to the soma, the refractory period, families of voltage-clamp traces, and the reversal potential of synaptic responses, are easily illustrated in MetaNeuron. Responses are displayed graphically and can be measured with a cursor. Families of traces can be generated and viewed in rotatable 3D plots.

The aim of the present study was to test if central noradrenergic processes are involved in the central sensitization of MDH neurons and if α1-adrenoceptors or α2-adrenoceptors or both are involved. In urethane/α-chloralose-anesthetized rats, the activity of extracellularly recorded and functionally identified single nociceptive neurons in the MDH was studied. Continuous intrathecal (i.t.) superfusion of the adrenergic modulator guanethidine and α-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine or selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin over the medulla strongly attenuated all three MO-induced parameters of central sensitization in the MDH nociceptive neurons, compared to phosphate-buffered saline (as vehicle control). In contrast, i.t. superfusion of the selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine had little effect on the mechanoreceptive field expansion and the decreased mechanical activation threshold, and indeed facilitated responses to noxious stimuli of sensitized nociceptive neurons. Superfusion of each of the four chemicals alone did not affect baseline nociceptive neuronal properties. These findings provide the first documentation of the involvement of central noradrenergic processes in MDH in the development of the central sensitization, and that α1- and α2-adrenoceptors may be differentially involved.', '23758907': 'Several chronic pain populations have demonstrated decreased conditioned pain modulation (CPM).

I use nationally representative time diary data on 7,662 respondents from the 2010 American Time Use Survey to measure individual rates of this switching behavior and to examine how this relates to perceived stress. Regression analysis shows that, net of how many social roles they play and settings they visit on a given day, individuals who switch more frequently between these elements report higher levels of stress.

ShK peptide from a sea anemone is one of the most potent blockers of Kv1.3 but its application as a therapeutic agent for autoimmune diseases is limited by its lack of selectivity against other Kv channels, in particular Kv1.1. Accurate models of Kv1.x-ShK complexes suggest that specific charge mutations on ShK could considerably enhance its specificity for Kv1.3. Here we evaluate the K18A mutation on ShK, and calculate the change in binding free energy associated with this mutation using the path-independent free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, with a novel implementation that avoids convergence problems. To check the accuracy of the results, the binding free energy differences were also determined from path-dependent potential of mean force calculations. The two methods yield consistent results for the K18A mutation in ShK and predict a 2 kcal/mol gain in Kv1.3/Kv1.1 selectivity free energy relative to wild-type peptide. Functional assays confirm the predicted selectivity gain for ShK[K18A] and suggest that it will be a valuable lead in the development of therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.', '24105517': 'Coherent detection through two opposing objectives (4Pi configuration) improves the precision of three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule localization substantially along the axial direction, but suffers from instrument complexity and maintenance difficulty. To address these issues, we have realized 4Pi fluorescence detection by sandwiching the sample between the objective and a mirror, and create interference of direct incidence and mirror-reflected signal at the camera with a spatial light modulator. Multifocal imaging using this single-objective mirror interference scheme offers improvement in the axial localization similar to the traditional 4Pi method. We have also devised several PSF engineering schemes to enable 3D localization with a single emitter image, offering better axial precision than normal single-objective localization methods such as astigmatic imaging.', '24135055': 'IFN-γ(-/-) NOD.H-2h4 mice develop a spontaneous autoimmune thyroid disease, thyroid epithelial cell hyperplasia and proliferation (TEC H/P) when given NaI in their water for 7+ mo. TEC H/P can be transferred to IFN-γ(-/-) SCID mice by splenocytes from mice with severe (4-5+) disease, and transfer of TEC H/P is improved when splenocytes are cultured prior to transfer. Older (9+ mo) IFN-γ(-/-) NOD.H-2h4 mice have elevated numbers of FoxP3(+) T reg cells, up to 2-fold greater than younger (2 mo) mice. During culture, the number of T reg decreases and this allows the improved transfer of TEC H/P. Co-culture with IL-2 prior to transfer prevents the decrease of T reg and improves their in vitro suppressive ability resulting in reduced TEC H/P in recipient mice. Therefore, culturing splenocytes improves transfer of TEC H/P by reducing the number of T reg and IL-2 inhibits transfer by preserving T reg number and function.', '23916715': 'Attentional biases are known to play a contributing, and perhaps even causal role in the etiology of anxiety and other negative affective states. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in the older cohort is growing, and there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to suspect that age-related factors could moderate attentional bias effects in the context of late-life anxiety. The current study included one of the most widely-used measures of attentional bias, the dot-probe task (Mathews & MacLeod, 1985). Participants were older adults who were either nonanxious or diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. The patient subsample also completed cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or an equivalent wait list condition, after which the dot probe was administered a second time. Results showed that clinical anxiety had no particular importance for the deployment of attention, casting doubt on the universality of biased attention in older anxiety patients. Although there were no maladaptive biases detected toward either threat or depression words at pretreatment, there was nevertheless a marginally significant differential reduction in bias toward threat words following CBT. This reduction did not occur among those in the wait list condition.

Immunodetection of phosphohistone H3 has been shown to facilitate the identification of mitotic figures in various neoplasms. We selected 120 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma with completely annotated histopathologic parameters and clinical outcomes and performed double immunohistochemical staining for MLANA (Mart-1/Melan-A) and phosphohistone H3. One hundred and thirteen cases were amenable to antiphosphohistone H3 staining from 66 men and 47 women, with mean age of 64 years (9-93), including 61 superficial spreading type, 24 nodular, 6 lentigo maligna, 8 acral lentiginous, and 14 unclassified. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.53\\u2009mm (0.20-25), ulceration was present in 25/113 (22%) and the mean mitotic count was 3.2/mm(2) (<1-29/mm(2)). In 27/113 (24%) of the cases, antiphosphohistone H3 failed to highlight mitotic figures anywhere in the tissue (normal or tumor cell), whereas in 86/113 (76%) antiphosphohistone H3 detected at least one mitotic figure. Among the latter, antiphosphohistone H3 did not detect mitotic figures in dermal tumor cells in 37/86 cases (43%), whereas anti-PHH3 identified at least one melanocytic mitotic figure in the other 49/86 cases (57%; range: 1-66/mm(2)). The relationship between phosphohistone H3 and manual mitotic count was statistically significant (Pearson correlation=0.59, P<0.0001). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated an association between the development of subsequent metastatic disease and the following variables: mitotic figures (odds ratio (OR)=5.7; P=0.0001); phosphohistone H3-positive mitotic figures (OR=3.0; P=0.008); Breslow thickness (OR=4.0\\u2009per mm; P=0.0002); ulceration (OR=3.94; P=0.008). The application of phosphohistone H3 immunohistochemistry to the description of primary cutaneous melanoma is useful in identifying mitotic figures, improves upon the specificity of this designation when used together with MLANA, and correlates with an increased risk for metastasis in univariate analyses.', '23903243': \"The relative reinforcing strength of drugs can be characterized by the distribution of operant behavior during the availability of other reinforcing stimuli. 'Choice' procedures are not widely used in rats, with the exception of ethanol self-administration in which there often is a choice between ethanol and water, which typically does not maintain much responding. A procedure was developed to evaluate the relative reinforcing strength of ethanol in rats when a similar appetitive reinforcer is concurrently available. Rats were trained to respond on two levers under concurrent fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement with milk (1-50%) or ethanol+milk (4-32% ethanol+5-10% milk). Daily 60-min sessions began with a forced sample of each reinforcer, followed by the concurrent schedules. Under this schedule, rats preferentially allocated their responding to the ethanol-associated lever under conditions of ethanol+5% milk versus 5% milk, but neither preferred nor avoided ethanol when ethanol+10% milk versus 10% milk was available. When 8% ethanol+5% milk was available, 85±6% of responses were directed toward the ethanol-associated lever and the mean ethanol intake was 1.55±0.10 g/kg. The response rate decreased monotonically with the concentration of ethanol. Naltrexone injections did not affect the distribution of responding, but slightly decreased ethanol intake. It is concluded that stable behavior can be maintained under concurrent fixed-ratio schedules of ethanol and milk presentation in rats, resulting in intake of behaviorally active amounts of ethanol.\", '23639321': 'With steadily improved cure rates for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), treating relapsed ALL has become increasingly challenging largely due to resistance to salvage therapy.

While gains in female wages contributed to declines in the gender wage gap for cohorts born before 1950, for later cohorts the narrowing of the gender wage gap is primarily a result of declines in male wages.', '24229152': \"Consider a finite-sized, multidimensional system in parameter state a. The system is either at statistical equilibrium or general nonequilibrium, and may obey either classical or quantum physics. L. Hardy's mathematical axioms provide a basis for the physics obeyed by any such system. One axiom is that the number N of distinguishable states a in the system obeys N=max. This assumes that N is known as deterministic prior knowledge. However, most observed systems suffer statistical fluctuations, for which N is therefore only known approximately. Then what happens if the scope of the axiom N=max is extended to include such observed systems? It is found that the state a of the system must obey a principle of maximum Fisher information, I=I(max). This is important because many physical laws have been derived, assuming as a working hypothesis that I=I(max). These derivations include uses of the principle of extreme physical information (EPI). Examples of such derivations were of the De Broglie wave hypothesis, quantum wave equations, Maxwell's equations, new laws of biology (e.g., of Coulomb force-directed cell development and of in situ cancer growth), and new laws of economic fluctuation and investment. That the principle I=I(max) itself derives from suitably extended Hardy axioms thereby eliminates its need to be assumed in these derivations.

Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) of oscillations in different frequency bands has been proposed as an effective mechanism to form functional networks to optimize transfer and integration of information. Here we assess PAC between theta and high gamma oscillations as a potential mechanism that facilitates motor adaptation. To address this issue we recorded intracranial field potentials directly from the bilateral human NAcc in three patients while they performed a motor learning task that varied in the level of cognitive control needed to perform the task. As in rodents, PAC was observable in the human NAcc, transiently occurring contralateral to a movement following the motor response. Importantly, PAC correlated with the level of cognitive control needed to monitor the action performed. This functional relation indicates that the NAcc is engaged in action monitoring and supports the evaluation of motor programs during adaptive behavior by means of PAC.', '23020925': 'The paired box homeotic gene 3 (PAX3) is a crucial regulator for the maintenance of melanocytic progenitor cells and has a poorly defined role in melanoma.

We also found that TBX2 is involved in the survival of melanoma cells and is overexpressed in some melanoma specimens.

In this study, rigorous psychophysical measures of threshold sensitivity, temporal gap detection, temporal order identification, and temporal masking have been obtained, in hearing, vision, and touch. In addition, all subjects completed 15 subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III). Data were obtained from 245 adults (18-87 years old) for the WAIS-III and for 40 measures of threshold sensitivity and temporal processing. The focus in this report is on individual differences in performance for the entire data set. Principal-components (PC) factor analysis reduced the 40 psychophysical measures to eight correlated factors, which were reduced further to a single global sensory processing factor. Similarly, PC factor analysis of the 15 WAIS-III scores resulted in three correlated factors that were further reduced to a single global cognitive function factor. Age, global sensory processing, and global cognitive function were all moderately and significantly correlated with one another. However, paired partial correlations, controlling for the third of these three measures, revealed that the moderate correlation between age and global cognitive function went to zero when global sensory processing was controlled for; the other two partial correlations remained intact. Structural models confirmed this result. These analyses suggest that the long-standing observation of age-related changes in cognitive function may be mediated by age-related changes in global sensory processing.', '23700422': 'Our previous studies indicated that recombinant rabies viruses (rRABV) expressing chemokines or cytokines (including GM-CSF) could enhance the immunogenicity by recruiting and/or activating dendritic cells (DC).

The i.m.-immunized mice were bled at three weeks after the immunization for the measurement of virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) and then challenged with 50 LD50 challenge virus standard (CVS-24). Orally immunized mice were boosted after three weeks and then bled and challenged one week after the booster immunization. It was found that both LBNSE-GMCSF and LBNSE-Flagellin recruited/activated more DCs and B cells in the periphery, stimulated higher levels of adaptive immune responses (VNA), and protected more mice against challenge infection than the parent virus LBNSE in both the i.m. and the orally immunized groups. Together, these studies suggest that recombinant RABV expressing GM-CSF or flagellin are more immunogenic than the parent virus in both i.m. and oral immunizations.', '23581554': 'Among two large, independent samples of girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we examined associations between specific (maternal gestational smoking and drug use, early labor, low birth weight, and infant breathing problems at birth) and cumulative prenatal and perinatal risk factors and psychiatric comorbidity during childhood. Data from the (a) Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD, a randomized clinical trial with 579 children aged 7 to 9.9 years with combined-type ADHD, and the (b) Berkeley Girls ADHD Longitudinal Sample, a naturalistic study of 140 girls with ADHD (93 combined-type and 47 inattentive-type) who were first seen when they were 6 to 12 years old, were analyzed separately. In each sample, perinatal risk factors were assessed retrospectively by maternal report, and current childhood psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using maternal report on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. Consistent findings across these two studies show that infant breathing problems, early labor, and total perinatal problems predicted childhood comorbid depression but not comorbid anxiety or externalizing disorders. These associations remained significant, in both samples, with control of family socioeconomic status (SES) and maternal symptoms of ADHD and depression. Results attenuated slightly with control of the number of child comorbidities plus SES and maternal symptoms. Accumulating evidence suggests that perinatal risk factors are important precursors of childhood psychiatric comorbidity and that the association between these risk factors and detrimental psychiatric outcomes cannot be explained by maternal psychiatric symptoms or SES during childhood.', '23550062': 'Genomic data and biomedical imaging data are undergoing exponential growth. However, our understanding of the phenotype-genotype connection linking the two types of data is lagging behind. While there are many types of software that enable the manipulation and analysis of image data and genomic data as separate entities, there is no framework established for linking the two. We present a generic set of software tools, BioDIG, that allows linking of image data to genomic data. BioDIG tools can be applied to a wide range of research problems that require linking images to genomes. BioDIG features the following: rapid construction of web-based workbenches, community-based annotation, user management and web services. By using BioDIG to create websites, researchers and curators can rapidly annotate a large number of images with genomic information. Here we present the BioDIG software tools that include an image module, a genome module and a user management module. We also introduce a BioDIG-based website, MyDIG, which is being used to annotate images of mycoplasmas.', '23173646': 'Stroke is a serious cerebrovascular disease that causes high mortality and persistent disability in adults worldwide. Stroke is also an enormous public health problem and a heavy public financial burden in the United States. Treatment for stroke is very limited. Thrombolytic therapy by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only approved treatment for acute stroke, and no effective treatment is available for chronic stroke. Developing new therapeutic strategies, therefore, is a critical need for stroke treatment. This article summarizes the discovery of new routes of treatment for acute and chronic stroke using two hematopoietic growth factors, stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In a study of acute stroke, SCF and G-CSF alone or in combination displays neuroprotective effects in an animal model of stroke. SCF appears to be the optimal treatment for acute stroke as the functional outcome is superior to G-CSF alone or in combination (SCF+G-CSF); however, SCF+G-CSF does show better functional recovery than G-CSF. In a chronic stroke study, the therapeutic effects of SCF and G-CSF alone or in combination appear differently as compared with their effects on the acute stroke. SCF+G-CSF induces stable and long-lasting functional improvement; SCF alone also improves functional outcome but its effectiveness is less than SCF+G-CSF, whereas G-CSF shows no therapeutic effects. Although the mechanism by which SCF+G-CSF repairs the brain in chronic stroke remains poorly understood, our recent findings suggest that the SCF+G-CSF-induced functional improvement in chronic stroke is associated with a contribution to increasing angiogenesis and neurogenesis through bone marrow-derived cells and the direct effects on stimulating neurons to form new neuronal networks. These findings would assist in developing new treatment for stroke. The article presents some promising patents on role of stem cell factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in treatment of stroke.', '24128716': 'Arsenic exposure is a significant cause of lung cancer in North America and worldwide. Arsenic-related tumors are structurally indistinguishable from those induced by other carcinogens.

At the time of the crisis the United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (USAID-AMPATH) Partnership was operating 17 primary HIV clinics in western Kenya and treating 59,437 HIV positive patients (23,437 on antiretroviral therapy (ART)).', '23510151': \"The concept of gene therapy is promising; however, the perceived risks and side effects associated with this technology have severely dampened the researchers' enthusiasm. Thus, the development of a nonviral gene vector without immunological effects and with high transfection efficiency is necessary. Currently, most nonviral vectors have failed to achieve the in vivo transfection efficiencies of viral vectors due to their toxicity, rapid clearance, and/or inappropriate release rates. Although our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the controlled-release of plasmid DNA (pDNA) polyplexes encapsulated into nanoparticles formulated with l-tyrosine polyphosphate (LTP-pDNA nanoparticles), the in vivo transfection capabilities and immunogenicity of this delivery system have yet to be examined. Thus, we evaluate LTP-pDNA nanoparticles in an in vivo setting via injection into rodent uterine tissue. Our results demonstrate through X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry of uterine tissue that transfection has successfully occurred after a nine-day incubation. In contrast, the results for the control nanoparticles show results similar to those of shams. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the injected tissues confirms the transfection in vivo. To examine the immunogenicity, the l-tyrosine polyphosphate (LTP) nanoparticles have been evaluated in a mouse model. No significant differences in the activation of the innate immune system are observed. These data provide the first report for the potential use of controlled-release nanoparticles formulated from an amino acid based polymer as an in vivo nonviral vector for gene therapy.\", '24110929': 'This paper presents an improved noise classification in environment-adaptive speech processing pipelines of cochlear implants. This improvement is achieved by using a dual-microphone and by using a computationally efficient feature-level combination approach to achieve real-time operation. A new measure named Suppression Advantage is also defined in order to quantify the noise suppression improvement of an entire pipeline due to noise classification. The noise classification and suppression improvement results are presented for four commonly encountered noise environments.', '23419283': 'Ras proteins on the plasma membrane are laterally segregated into transient nanoclusters that are essential for high-fidelity signal transmission by the Ras/MAPK cascade. The dynamics of Ras nanocluster assembly and disassembly control MAPK signal output. BRaf inhibitors paradoxically activate CRaf and MAPK signaling in Ras-transformed cells. In our recent study, we showed that BRaf inhibition significantly enhances nanoclustering of oncogenic K- and N-Ras, but not H-Ras by increasing the frequency of Ras nanocluster formation. This disrupted spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras nanocluster fully accounts for the observed effects of Raf inhibitors on Ras signal transmission. Here together with other studies, we propose that the dynamics of Ras nanoclusters may represent a novel target for future therapeutic intervention.', '23401064': 'This study tests whether changes in licensed nurse staffing led to changes in patient safety, using the natural experiment of 2004 California implementation of minimum staffing ratios. We calculated counts of six patient safety outcomes from California Patient Discharge Data from 2000 through 2006, using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) software. For patients experiencing nonmortality-related PSIs, we measured mean lengths of stay. We estimated difference-in-difference equations of changes in PSIs using Poisson models and calculated the marginal impact of nurse staffing on outcomes from fixed-effect Poisson regressions. Licensed nurse staffing increased in the postregulation period, except for hospitals in the highest quartile of preregulation staffing. Growth in registered nurse staffing was associated with improvement for only one PSI and reduced length of stay for one PSI. Higher registered nurse staffing per patient day had a limited impact on adverse events in California hospitals.', '23485712': 'In vitro primary hepatocyte systems typically elicit drug induction and toxicity responses at concentrations much higher than corresponding in vivo or clinical plasma C(max) levels, contributing to poor in vitro-in vivo correlations. This may be partly due to the absence of physiological parameters that maintain metabolic phenotype in vivo. We hypothesized that restoring hemodynamics and media transport would improve hepatocyte architecture and metabolic function in vitro compared with nonflow cultures. Rat hepatocytes were cultured for 2 wk either in nonflow collagen gel sandwiches with 48-h media changes or under controlled hemodynamics mimicking sinusoidal circulation within a perfused Transwell device. Phenotypic, functional, and metabolic parameters were assessed at multiple times. Hepatocytes in the devices exhibited polarized morphology, retention of differentiation markers [E-cadherin and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α)], the canalicular transporter [multidrug-resistant protein-2 (Mrp-2)], and significantly higher levels of liver function compared with nonflow cultures over 2 wk (albumin ~4-fold and urea ~5-fold). Gene expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was significantly higher (fold increase over nonflow: CYP1A1: 53.5 ± 10.3; CYP1A2: 64.0 ± 15.1; CYP2B1: 15.2 ± 2.9; CYP2B2: 2.7 ± 0.8; CYP3A2: 4.0 ± 1.4) and translated to significantly higher basal enzyme activity (device vs. nonflow: CYP1A: 6.26 ± 2.41 vs. 0.42 ± 0.015; CYP1B: 3.47 ± 1.66 vs. 0.4 ± 0.09; CYP3A: 11.65 ± 4.70 vs. 2.43 ± 0.56) while retaining inducibility by 3-methylcholanthrene and dexamethasone (fold increase over DMSO: CYP1A = 27.33 and CYP3A = 4.94). These responses were observed at concentrations closer to plasma levels documented in vivo in rats. The retention of in vivo-like hepatocyte phenotype and metabolic function coupled with drug response at more physiological concentrations emphasizes the importance of restoring in vivo physiological transport parameters in vitro.', '24156560': 'Heteroaromatic secondary alcohols react with isoprene to form products of hydrohydroxyalkylation in the presence of ruthenium(0) catalysts generated from Ru3(CO)12 and tricyclohexylphosphine, enabling direct conversion of secondary to tertiary alcohols in the absence of premetalated reagents or stoichiometric byproducts.

The development of new, affordable antimalarial drugs is of vital importance as there are increasing reports of resistance to the currently available therapeutics. In addition, most of the current drugs used for chemoprophylaxis merely act on parasites already replicating in the blood. At this point, a patient might already be suffering from the symptoms associated with the disease and could additionally be infectious to an Anopheles mosquito. These insects act as a vector, subsequently spreading the disease to other humans. In order to cure not only malaria but prevent transmission as well, a drug must target both the blood- and pre-erythrocytic liver stages of the parasite. P. falciparum (Pf) enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (ENR) is a key enzyme of plasmodial type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II). It has been shown to be essential for liver-stage development of Plasmodium berghei and is therefore qualified as a target for true causal chemoprophylaxis. Using virtual screening based on two crystal structures of PfENR, we identified a structurally novel class of FAS inhibitors. Subsequent chemical optimization yielded two compounds that are effective against multiple stages of the malaria parasite. These two most promising derivatives were found to inhibit blood-stage parasite growth with IC(50) values of 1.7 and 3.0 μM and lead to a more prominent developmental attenuation of liver-stage parasites than the gold-standard drug, primaquine.', '23212453': 'Negative affect promotes dysregulated alcohol consumption in non-dependent and alcohol-dependent animals, and cues associated with negative affective states induce withdrawal-like symptoms in rats. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (1) the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system mediates phenotypes related to alcohol withdrawal and withdrawal-like negative affective states and (2) cues associated with negative affective states would result in dysregulated alcohol consumption when subsequently presented alone. To accomplish these goals, intracerebroventricular infusion of the KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) was assessed for the ability to attenuate the increase in 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) associated with alcohol withdrawal and KOR activation in adult male wistar rats. Furthermore, cues associated with a KOR agonist-induced negative affective state were assessed for the ability to dysregulate alcohol consumption and the efficacy of intracerebroventricular KOR antagonism to reduce such dysregulation was evaluated. KOR antagonism blocked the increased number of 22-kHz USVs observed during acute alcohol withdrawal and a KOR agonist (U50,488) resulted in a nor-BNI reversible increase in 22-kHz USVs (mimicking an alcohol-dependent state). Additionally, cues associated with negative affective states resulted in escalated alcohol self-administration, an effect that was nor-BNI sensitive. Taken together, this study implicates negative affective states induced by both alcohol withdrawal and conditioned stimuli as being produced, in part, by activity of the DYN/KOR system.', '24455475': 'This study was designed to assess the relationship between insulin resistance and incident heart failure (HF) in a community-based cohort.', '23732991': \"The use of lytic viruses to preferentially infect and eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal cells is a promising experimental therapeutic approach for treating cancer. However, the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy is often limited by two innate immunity pathways, the protein kinase PKR and the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (OAS)/RNase L systems, which are widely present in many but not all tumor cell types. Previously, we reported that the anticancer drug, sunitinib, an inhibitor of VEGF-R and PDGF-R, has off-target effects against both PKR and RNase L. Here we show that combining sunitinib treatments with infection by an oncolytic virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), led to the elimination of prostate, breast, and kidney malignant tumors in mice. In contrast, either virus or sunitinib alone slowed tumor progression but did not eliminate tumors. In prostate tumors excised from treated mice, sunitinib decreased levels of the phosphorylated form of translation initiation factor, eIF2-α, a substrate of PKR, by 10-fold while increasing median viral titers by 23-fold. The sunitinib/VSV regimen caused complete and sustained tumor regression in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent animals. Results indicate that transient inhibition of innate immunity with sunitinib enhances oncolytic virotherapy allowing the recovery of tumor-bearing animals.\", '23951286': 'The purpose of this work was to reveal the metabolic features of mitochondria that might be essential for inhibition of apoptotic potential in prostate cancer cells. We studied mitochondria isolated from normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), metastatic prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, DU145; and non-prostate cancer cells - human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells; and normal human lymphoblastoid cells. PrEC cells contained 2 to 4 times less mitochondria per gram of cells than the three PC cell lines. Respiratory activities of PrEC cell mitochondria were 5-20-fold lower than PC mitochondria, depending on substrates and the metabolic state, due to lower content and lower activity of the respiratory enzyme complexes. Mitochondria from the three metastatic prostate cancer cell lines revealed several features that are distinctive only to these cells: low affinity of Complex I for NADH, 20-30 mV higher electrical membrane potential (ΔΨ). Unprotected with cyclosporine A (CsA) the PC-3 mitochondria required 4 times more Ca²⁺ to open the permeability transition pore (mPTP) when compared with the PrEC mitochondria, and they did not undergo swelling even in the presence of alamethicin, a large pore forming antibiotic. In the presence of CsA, the PC-3 mitochondria did not open spontaneously the mPTP. We conclude that the low apoptotic potential of the metastatic PC cells may arise from inhibition of the Ca²⁺-dependent permeability transition due to a very high ΔΨ and higher capacity to sequester Ca²⁺. We suggest that due to the high ΔΨ, mitochondrial metabolism of the metastatic prostate cancer cells is predominantly based on utilization of glutamate and glutamine, which may promote development of cachexia.', '23927136': 'Quantitative measures of acoustic similarity can reveal patterns of shared vocal behavior in social species. Many methods for computing similarity have been developed, but their performance has not been extensively characterized in noisy environments and with vocalizations characterized by complex frequency modulations. This paper describes methods of bioacoustic comparison based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of the fundamental frequency or spectrogram. Fundamental frequency is estimated using a Bayesian particle filter adaptation of harmonic template matching. The methods were tested on field recordings of flight calls from superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus, for how well they could separate distinct categories of call elements (motifs). The fundamental-frequency-based method performed best, but the spectrogram-based method was less sensitive to noise. Both DTW methods provided better separation of categories than spectrographic cross correlation, likely due to substantial variability in the duration of superb starling flight call motifs.', '23827426': 'Genetic mutations play a crucial role in the etiology of cryptogenic infantile spasms, but the cause is still unknown in a significant proportion of patients.
